<h1>Mail app with AI based on Postal framework</h1>

<p>This repo contains the iOS mail app developed with the <a href="https://github.com/snipsco/Postal" title="Postal">Postal</a> framework for
reasearch on AI (authorship verification and phishing recognition). It will use
<a href="https://uclassify.com" title="uClassify">uClassify</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml" title="Core ML 3">Core ML 3</a> for the AI part.</p>

<h2>How to setup?</h2>

<p>Please have a look for the setup description in the <a href="https://github.com/cfinker/postal-demo-extended-with-authorship-verification/tree/master/README.md" title="README.md">README.md</a> file in root folder of this repo. There you will find all needed details. Short version: Just open the Xcode porject of this folder and then a build should be able, even thought some warnings/errors will occure upon opening the project in Xcode.</p>

<p>Remark: Do NOT run any carthage updates or try to update any dependencies. Since Postal framework changed a lot in the last few months a update of the project dependencies will cause build errors and need some fixes in order to get the project running again.</p>

<h2>uClassify API keys and user</h2>

<p>The uClassify user and API keys can be set in the Info tab of the PostalDemo XCode project (Custom iOS Target Properties).</p>

<ul>
<li>UCLASSIFY_READ_KEY</li>
<li>UCLASSIFY_WRITE_KEY</li>
<li>UCLASSIFY_USER_API</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mail not working?</h2>

<p>Please keep always in mind, that this project is only a prototype for answering scenctific questions. Therefore, not all mail providers have been tested. I always used a Gmail account, but there I had to deactive some security settings, to allow 'unsecure' applikation to login with e-mail address and password. Unfortunalty, the error messages of Postal are also sometimes not very helpful (this aspect cost a lot of time in the begin of the project).</p>

<h2>Planned features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Add one single mail account, save credientails in keychain</li>
<li>Receive all mails via IMAP and show in one single list </li>
<li>Each mail can be viewed in detail, with its content as plain text</li>
<li>Send all already received mails per click to classifiers and create/train models by a single click</li>
<li>Send data to classifieres and show results in mail detail view</li>
</ul>
