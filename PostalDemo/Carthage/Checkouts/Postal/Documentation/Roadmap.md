# Roadmap

A lot has been done, but many more is still missing.
These are the things we would like to see happen in Postal :

- [ ] more documentation
- [ ] CocoaPods subspec for RxSwift
- [ ] CocoaPods try pod demo integration
- [ ] TravisCI integration
- [ ] Improve libetpan with more constness and int/long to allow more fluent interactions with swift
- [ ] SPM integration (with linux integration)
- [ ] Find ways to add robust tests to the parsing / wrapping
- [ ] tvOS? watchOS ? 
- [ ] your own proposition, please [contribute](https://github.com/snipsco/Postal/issues)
