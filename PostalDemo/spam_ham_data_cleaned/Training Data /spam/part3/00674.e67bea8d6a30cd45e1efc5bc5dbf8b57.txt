Finally, a safe and natural penile enlargement
supplement!
Naturally boost your sex drive and rejuvenate sexual
function.

Good news, men! Recent
discoveries in herbal medicine have made it possible for men to
safely and effectively boost their sexual vitality while increasing
their penis size by 25% or more!

Certified Natural Laboratories is pleased to introduce the
latest addition to their widely acclaimed line of herbal
supplements: Maxaman™.

Specially formulated with herbs and extracts from around
the globe, Maxaman™ can help to enhance sexual sensitivity,
increase sexual stamina, and actually increase the size of your
penis by up to 25%. The special blend of herbs in Maxaman™
have been shown to boost blood flow to the penis, thus expanding
the sponge-like erectile tissue in the penis, leading to size gains
in both length and thickness.

A
recent survey showed that 68% of women are unsatisfied with the
size of their partners. Of course most of these women would never
tell their partner that they are unhappy with their penis size.
Having a small or average-sized penis can result in depression and
feelings of inadequacy. Thankfully, men of all ages can now safely
and naturally increase the size of their penis and renew sexual
vitality without resorting to dangerous surgery.

What To
Expect:

1-2 weeks
Most men notice more powerful and longer lasting erections almost
immediately. A noticeable increase in thickness is also
common.

3-8 weeks
By this point you should be able to notice an increase in
thickness in both erect and flaccid states, as well as an overall
increase in length.

9 weeks +
After nine weeks, your penis should be noticeably larger in both
length and girth.

Below is a comparison chart compiled from the most recent
data on penis size. See how you measure up...

How to measure your penis size
correctly: To determine length, measure the erect penis
from the base of the penis where the top of the shaft meets the
pubic area (the peno-pubic junction) to the tip of the head. For
uncircumcised men the foreskin should be retracted. To determine
width, measure at mid-shaft around the circumference while the
penis is erect.

Whether you have a small, average or large penis, it is now
possible for you to increase the size of your penis by up to 25%
without resorting to dangerous surgery or cumbersome
weights.

The proprietary blend of herbs
found in Maxaman™ consists of:

Zinc (as zinc oxide) - This essential mineral is required for
protein synthesis and collagen formation. Sufficient intake and
absorption of zinc are needed to maintain a proper concentration of
Vitamin E.

Yohimbe - Used traditionally to treat impotence and frigidity,
Yohimbe helps to increase blood flow and sensitivity of nerves,
especially in the pelvic region. It is commonly used as an
aphrodisiac to stimulate sexual organs and improve central nervous
system function.

Maca - Maca is an adaptogen. It works to create harmony in the
body, regulating levels of hormones and enzymes to create a state
of homeostasis.

Catuaba - Native to Brazil and parts of the Amazon, Catuaba is
a central nervous system stimulant commonly used throughout the
world for treating sexual impotence, exhaustion and fatigue.

Muira Puama - A South American herb, Muira Puama has been

after for its strong stimulant qualities.

Oyster Meat - Historically
known as an aphrodisiac, oyster meat contains flavonoids that have
been shown to stimulate the reproductive system.

L-Arginine - L-Arginine
is an amino acid which helps to create nitric oxide in the human
body. Nitric oxide is the most essential substance influencing
sexual function in both men and women. Nitric oxide promotes
circulation, resulting in improved blood flow.

Oatstraw - Used to
treat fatigue and exhaustion, Oatstraw improves brain and nervous
system function and has been used to treat impotence. It is
extremely useful for aiding your body in recovering from
exhaustion, as well as correcting sexual debility.

diuretic, expectorant and tonic. It is rich in iron and chlorophyll
to clean and nourish the blood.

Cayenne - Cayenne improves
circulation, increases the metabolic rate and acts as a catalyst
for other herbs.

hormone function. Myosin, an amino acid found in pumpkin seeds, is

the coast of Peru, Sarsaparilla aids in the production of
testosterone and progesterone.

Orchic Substance - This is an
extract from bovine testes, and is proven to increase testosterone
levels without harmful steroids.

viral, bacterial and parasitic infection. Licorice cleanses the
colon, and enhances microcirculation in the gastrointestinal
lining.

Tribulus - A natural testosterone enhancer, Tribulus can

is also an excellent circulatory and heart tonic and can help
dilate arteries. In India it is used as a tonic for the urinary
system.

Ginseng Blend (Siberian, American & Korean) - Commonly used by athletes for overall body strengthening,
Ginseng fortifies the adrenal gland, and promotes healthy
circulation. It increases the conversion rate of sugars into the
necessary substrates for the formation of fatty acids in the liver.
Ginseng stimulates the central nervous system, and is a quick
antidote for fatigue.

Astragalus - Regarded as a potent
tonic for increasing energy levels and stimulating the immune
system, Astragalus has also been employed effectively as a
