This comprehensive LTCI policy review compares over 40 major companies
in 17 benefit and ratings/asset categories and includes a premium
comparison for a 60 year old couple.

Over 210 policies are covered in this semi-annual publication. This is
the oldest LTC policy comparison in the nation and is a valuable tool
for any agent selling LTC insurance today.

(Older generation policies are kept after new policies are introduced
because agents encounter the older policies in the field.)

The CD-ROM version allows you to compare up to three companies at a time
in any of the 17 categories. You'll also receive a spreadsheet version
to take with you all the time.

We don't want anybody to receive our mailings who does not wish to
receive them. This is professional communication sent to insurance
