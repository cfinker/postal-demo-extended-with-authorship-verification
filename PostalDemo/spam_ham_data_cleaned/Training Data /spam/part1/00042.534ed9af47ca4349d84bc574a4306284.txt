Here is a sample of just a few of the letters we receive every week
thanking us for what our product has done:

"I am astounded! The day before I started taki=
ng the GH1,
I took blood tests. Then I began using the GH1 as directed.
After 8 weeks I took blood tests again.
My IGF-1 level (evidence of GH) showed a 70% increase!
Furthermore, my cholesterol score went from 190 down to 144!
I definitely feel better overall and certainly have more energy.
To say the least I am very impressed and pleased with GH1.
My "biological" age is now that of a 40 year old!"
-Dr. A. Zuckerman M.D., age 60, NY

"A year ago, my blood pressure was 180/120 and I was on blood
pressure medication. I also started the Anti-Aging formula, GH1.
After a year on the product, my blood pressure is now 120/80--
and I haven't been on the blood pressure medication for months!"
-Susanne Peters, Laguna Beach, CA

"After 2 weeks on Anti-Aging Formula GH1, I noticed a higher
level of energy, increased sexual energy and my memory and vision
were enhanced. My blood pressure is down to 126/84 after workout-and
it seems every other day I have to 'rev-up' the amps on the treadmill
at the gym. I've noticed a tightening of the skin under my chin and
a change in my lungs with much easier breathing. After 4 months,
I only need 5 hours sleep instead of 7. One morning, I had to do an extra =

karate workout just to expend all the extra energy!" "After 6 months on
GH1, my blood sugar levels went from 130 down to 65! Also, my stamina has =

increased, as well as my energy and sex drive--this product is GREAT!"
-Dr. Richard Boyd, 78 years old, Harvard Clinical Psychologist, CA

"As a straight-ahead bicycle racer, I used to have to wait a minute
and a half after sprinting, for my heart rate to come down to where
I could sprint again. After a month on GH1, I can now sprint again
after only 45 seconds! GH1 cut my waiting time in half!"
-Ed Caz, age 40, Fresno,CA

"When I heard GH1 would reduce body fat increase lean muscle WITHOUT EXERC=
ISE, I couldn't believe it--but in just a few months I lost 4 inches aroun=
d my waist without exercising and my body fat went from 22 down to 19--eve=
n though I gained 10 pounds! Also, after 4 months, my fine vision returned=
. I no longer need the magnifying glasses to read fine print."
-Larry Baker, age 54,Oceanside, CA

"I have been taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 for five months now.
I have been under great stress in my business.
I believe that taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 has had a big part in keeping=

my energy level up and having the strength to stay positive in the midst
of discouraging circumstances. Last week I came down with a cold.
Colds are tough on me and seem to run their course- headaches, sinus infla=
mmation, and then throat. I am progressing through those stages but more q=
uickly than before. Hallelujah! My eyes aren't as puffy and the skin on my=
hands snaps back faster.
My muscles seem to have better tone-I notice it in my legs-and I have more=
energy
when I go out walking."
- Carolyn Munn

"I was taking injections of GH for over one year. A friend suggested that =

I try Anti-Aging Formula GH1, since I was spending 1,000 US dollars a mont=
h and needed
a doctor to inject it daily. In 2-3 weeks I felt better from the Anti-Agin=
g
Formula GH1 than the whole time I was getting the injections.
Thank you Anti-Aging Formula for greatly helping to improve my life!"
-Rita Mills McCoy

"I have had elevated cholesterol levels since the first time I was tested,=

in my twenties. I was on Anti-Aging Formula GHI for only 1 month when my l=
evels
dropped from 245 to 210. I could hardly believe it! After 3 months on Anti=
-Aging
Formula GH1 my gray hair began to darken at the roots, returning to its no=
rmal
coloring. I have even been able to reduce my thyroid medication. All of th=
is
without having to change anything else about my lifestyle, other than taki=
ng
few sprays of Anti-Aging Formula GH1 a day. Wow!
-Alan Ross, 43 years old

GH1 is the highest concentration of orally administered GH1
available on the market today. Injections of GH taken in international uni=
ts are usually prescribed to be taken as a shot, two times per day. The in=
dividual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. GH1 has over 2000n=
g per dosage and was created to imitate the body's natural secretion of GH=
.

WHAT IS GROWTH HORMONE (GH)?

Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which =

is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the=

endocrine system. GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically=

similar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few=

hours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones=

secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughou=
t
the body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence.

Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are new=
ly made.
The body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously=

dying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their orig=
inal
cells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced =
to
store memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the abili=
ty
to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone.

Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related=
symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased =
muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decrease=
d mental function and loss of libido.
When growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the =

all-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing subs=
tance
which is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the
proper dosage amounts.

GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, test=
osterone,
melatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are=
tiny
chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to r=
egulate
the activities of the vital organs. The word "hormone" is derived from a G=
reek word
meaning to stimulate. Many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some=
of the
effects of aging; however, GH reaches far beyond the scope of these other =

hormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatl=
y
reverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, includi=
ng
making the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also
helps restore hair color and hair loss.

THE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH?

Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its pr=
oduction
gradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 falls abou=
t 14% per
decade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. While GH is n=
ot new,
its availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and=
physicians
have been using GH for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consist=
ent results.
Unfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only t=
he medical
profession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Another proble=
m has been
that the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had bee=
n only
effective administered through injections. However, a new technology devel=
oped by
Anti-Aging Inc., now makes GH an effective, affordable and convenient alte=
rnative.

GH production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61

Growth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tes=
ted to date.
The amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade.
This results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half b=
y the age
of 60. Humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, =

200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. Between the=
ages
of 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results=
in SDS,
or Somatotrophin Deficiency Syndrome. These symptoms are part of the disea=
se called
aging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrenc=
e.
Healing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility.
Those who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should incl=
ude
an effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen.

After numerous clinical studies, the following was determined
after 6 or more months of GH therapy:

_ Improved memory
_ Regenerating of the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and o=
ther organs
_ Increased sexual drive and performance
_ Increased fertility
_ Enhanced immune system
_ Quicker wound and fracture healing
_ New hair growth and color reparation
_ Sharper vision
_ Improved exercise performance and tolerance
_ Increased muscle mass without exercise
_ Reduction of cellulite and fat
_ Increased stamina and vitality
_ Reduction in high blood pressure
_ Improvement in sleep
_ Anti-aging
_ Wrinkle reduction and smoothing
_ Decrease in LDL (bad) cholesterol
_ Increase in HDL (good) cholesterol
_ Strengthening of bones

IS GH SAFE?

GH has been successfully used in the medical community
for over thirty years and has been studies for over 60 years.
Edmond Klein, M.D. and L. Cas Terry Ph.D., tested over
800 individuals and reported in their 1995 study that
GH had substantial benefits and no side effects.
