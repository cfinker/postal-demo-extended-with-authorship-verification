What Causes Snoring?

Over-relaxed throat and tongue muscles due to poor throat muscle
Excessive fat on the throat
Accumulation of secretion in the back of the throat and
Throat swelling from allergies and food
Heavy snoring is often associated with apnea, or the stopping
of breathing, during sleep. As
an individuals sleeps his or her sleeping pattern is disrupted and fragmented
due to snoring, thus they are never well rested. This can be a very hazardous
problem if someone is not getting proper REM sleep. Snoring is the audible
symptom of a blocked airway during sleep.

The noise is caused by a vibration in the soft palate as the lungs pull hard
to take in a weakened current of incoming air. This blockage may result
from any number of circumstances, and these offer clues to get rid of the
problem.
Snoring is also more than likely to occur among people who sleep on their
backs; the tongue falls back toward the throat and partly closes the airway.

The hidden dangers of snoring?

Snoring could increase the chances of a heart attack if not treated
Hypertension and increased anxiety are associated with snoring
Snoring causes sleep apnea a serious treatable medical condition

Snoring decreases sexual performance
by half, due to lack of oxygen
to the brain which decreases sexual responsiveness.
Most people who snore have a shortage
of oxygen for a
significant portion of that person's life. In recent studies, daytime fatigue
and cardiovascular disorder are related to snoring. In a few cases, heavy
snoring is a sign of potentially life -threatening problem. Sleep apnea in which
breathing stops for a second or even minutes at a time and finally resumes with
snorting and tossing around. This pattern may be repeated hundreds of times all
night long. The result is chronic oxygen shortage, which leads to abnormal heart
rhythms, high blood pressure, and heart strain.

How the Snore Eliminator works!

Snore Eliminator offers a unique break through with its all natural
enzymes which metabolize the
secretions, allowing the body to absorb them into the back of the throat. The
herbs reduce tissue swelling. The result is to open the airway and smooth the
airflow. This in turn eliminates the snoring for hours at a time. It also
reduces the noise made by
breathing through the mouth while sleeping.
By simply spraying the back of the throat, tongue and uvula with our special
formula, manufactured using our patented break through process, the soft tissue
is coated. This allows the throat
a chance to relax thus a
reduced amount of snoring. In most cases snoring is eliminated. Snore Eliminator
coats the throat area with a unique patented process of all natural lubricants.

TESTIMONIALS from several of our satisfied customers:

Lorenzo writes...
I am having a good nights sleep, finally. I used to wake myself up during the
night which was a real bummer as I would not always go back to sleep. Sleeping
through the night is great. Thanks a lot Snore Eliminator.
PS: My girlfriend loves it as much or more than I do.
Alex writes...
My husband uses it for another reason. He has a problem with blocked nasal
passages. While he's asleep the passages close, he stops breathing and he wakes
up gasping. When he takes Snore Eliminator his nose stays clearer and he's able
to sleep more restfully.
Thank you for a product that has really helped us!
Glen writes...
In February 1995, I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. A CPAP was the
suggested treatment for my affliction, but it did not help my condition. I heard
your advertisement and ordered a bottle of Snore Eliminator and my sleep
improved immediately. I continue to use it and my sleep has been better than it
had been in years. Thanks.
