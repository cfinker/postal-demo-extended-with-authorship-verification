Hi
Jm,
Thanks
for visiting http://www.seekercenter.net.

Over
90% web surfers use search engines to locate their needed
info nowadays, so your web site is only effective when people
can find it. If you are not listed on search engines - you
lose. Nobody shows up no matter how attractive you made your
site. As well, the investment you made in building it will
not yield any dividends at all!
As
a popular site promotion tool, SeekerCenter uniquely submits
your website to 500,000+ search engines and directories worldwide,
attracting great traffic to your business website.
If
you wish someone could step you through SeekerCenter WebPromoter
program, you can check at http://www.seekercenter.net/faq.php.

If
you'd like to view to which search engines & directories
we submit your web site, please check http://www.seekercenter.net/engines.php.
