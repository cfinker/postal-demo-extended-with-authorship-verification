Selling Travel in Today's Economy

Good morning!

Since it may have been awhile since you visited us
at www.mailpound.com I
wanted to update you on what is happening. When we launched the MailPound
almost two years ago, our focus was on saving "Time, Toner and
Trees" by providing an alternative for organizing the huge
number of faxes suppliers sent travel agents each week. Our most popular
feature was the FAM section, followed by the Weekly Sweepstakes.

But that has changed.

Like many involved in selling retail travel, we have been
striving to find ways to succeed in a challenging environment. Additional
commission cuts, the aftermath of 9/11, and the drop in the stock
market, has
had a cumulative effect on all of us. To survive, to succeed, we know
that we
will need to work harder, work smarter, and work together. We have
gotten a
tremendous amount of support from travel agents and this has translated
into
the ability to get more support for travel agents from suppliers.

Our focus has expanded from providing a resource for
searching supplier
Special Offers to providing a suite of tools and services that can create
sales and raise commissions. Almost all of these services are supplier
supported and FREE to travel agents.
