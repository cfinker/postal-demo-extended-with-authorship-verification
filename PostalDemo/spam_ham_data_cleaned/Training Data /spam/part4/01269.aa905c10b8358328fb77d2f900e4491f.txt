READING THIS MESSAGE WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE =
FOREVER !!!!!! PLEASE READ THIS ALL!!!!!!!!! !!!! NOT A SCAM!!!! =
!!! I REPEAT NOT A SCAM!!! THIS ONLY COST YOU 6.00 CASH!!! =
INVESTMENT!!! IT DOES WORK!!! I found this on a bulletin board and =
decided to try it. A little while back, I was browsing through =
newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to =
this that said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with =
only an initial investment of $6.00! So I thought, Yeah right, this must =
be a scam", but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. =
Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address =
stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the =
bottom of the list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 =
newsgroups. (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after =
thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about =
trying it. I figured: "what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and =
$6.00, right?" Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!?... =
Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I =
figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my =
first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had =
made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third week I had over $10,000.00 =
and it's still growing. This is how my fourth week and I have made a =
total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. It's =
certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on the =
lottery!!(This is not me but i am also making alot of =
money) Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, =
WHY it works... Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so =
you can get the information off of it, as you need it. I promise you =
that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making =
more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy! =
Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (Print it out or =
download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the as money comes =
in! It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus =
postage) IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; =
it is not illegal; and it is 99% no risk - it really works! If all of =
the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive =
extraordinary dividends. PLEASE NOTE: Please follow =
these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 =
days. This program remains successful because of the honesty and =
integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully =
adhering to the instructions. You will be part of the Mail Order =
business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it's =
a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many =
large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. =
However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the =
income, which is made from people like you and me asking to be included =
in that list. Here are the 4 easy steps to success: STEP 1: Get =
6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of =
paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get 6 US $1.00 bills =
and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not =
be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one =
paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 =
sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, =
your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating =
a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate =
service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little =
skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I =
checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they =
confirmed that it is indeed legal. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following =
addresses: #1) Mike Gordon, 204 South Maple St., Winchester, =
KY.40391 #2) Jeff Waldrop, 39-A Lucy Rd., Laurel, MS 39443 #3) =
Brian Thompson, 15 Briggs Pond WY. Sharon, MA 02067 #4) A. Guy , =
6127 Seabree LN, ,Ft. Wayne, In 46835 #5) Wes Armstrong, 157 =
Butternut Rd., Shavertown, PA 18708 #6) Trista Friend, P.O. Box =
1265, Long Beach, WA 98631 STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the =
list that you see above, move the other names up 1 place (#2 becomes =
#1, #3 becomes #2, etc.) and add YOUR name and address as number 6 on =
the list. STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep =
this article as close to original as possible. Now, post your =
amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to =
24,000 groups) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the =
more money you make! You won't get very much unless you post like crazy. =
This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 =
Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these =
steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, =
and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful =
because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by their =
carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of =
integrity, the program will continue and the money that so many =
others have received will come your way. NOTE: You may want to =
retain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard =
copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are =
truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 =
bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So, as each post =
is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six members will be =
reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar =
each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your =
name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars =
in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the =
first six people listed above) Send it now, and add your own name to the =
list and you're in business! -----DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO =
POST TO NEWSGROUPS-------------- Step 1) You do not need to re-type =
this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the =
beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this =
document, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will copy the =
entire letter into the computer's memory. Step 2) Open a blank =
'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From =
the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter =
into notepad so that you can add your name to the list. Step =
3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your =
postings in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back =
to. Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching =
for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, =
discussions.) Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this =
article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and =
selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will =
be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of =
postings in a particular group, click the post message button. You're =
done with your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to =
do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang =
of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! =
**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU =
WILL MAKE! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** that's it! =
You will begin receiving money from around the world within days! You =
may eventually want to rent a P.O. Box due to the large amount of =
mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent =
a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE =
ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT. ** Now, each of the 5 persons who =
just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at =
#5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another =
$25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at =
#4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $125.00! Now, =
those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at =
#3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $625.00! =
OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM =
200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, =
that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this =
message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per =
200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original =
investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the =
list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out =
another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. =
And start posting again. Do you TURN 6 (six) DOLLARS INTO $6000 or even =
$60000 EASY AND HONESTLY!!! The thing to remember is: do you =
realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the =
Internet and reading these articles everyday? JUST LIKE YOU are now!! =
So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... =
People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one sends you =
the money?" So what! What are the chances of that happening when there =
are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the =
Internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? =
Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands =
of those joining the actual Internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY =
and this will really work.
