For C++, guru of the week at
http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/index.htm (can get them in book form and
with extra material as Herb Sutters Essential C++ and More Essential C++)
is a good resource.

Scott Meyers Effective C++, More Effective C++ and Effective STL
are truly handy books.

I always felt that The C++ faq wasn't as good as the C faq, but
it lives at http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/

C.
