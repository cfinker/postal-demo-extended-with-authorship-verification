Hey Joel,
Your message wasn't clear if you are cancelling a
regular earthlink account or the Omnisky inherited one.
I'm sure if you call their customer service number
they can unsubscribe you. I took me 4 tries,
so make sure you get a confirmation number. They'll
try and not give you one and ignore your call just
to make it really inconvenient.

Out of interest, what search engine and term did you
do to find that article?
