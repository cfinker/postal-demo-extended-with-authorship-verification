i sort my mail into folders using procmail. so typically i'm in the
ilug folder for ilug mail, the doolin folder for doolin mail, etc.
so i use folder-hooks to accomplish that. as an example (i do line
wrapping to keep it less then 80 chars long - spacing is important):

folder-hook . "my_hdr From: kevin lyda ;"\
"my_hdr X-GPG-Fingerprint: 9C1D 16F4 11F1 6BD2 933C 048D ACC7 9840 89D0 7646;"\
"set pgp_sign_as=0x89D07646;set signature=~/.signature;"\
"set folder=~/Mail;set record=~/Mail/outbox;set postponed=~/Mail/postponed"
folder-hook /(alphyra|Alphyra/[^.].*) \
"my_hdr From: kevin lyda ;my_hdr X-GPG-Fingerprint: "\
"088E 2BC4 381E 990A 1E0E 1DA0 4D44 99EF 20E6 38A0;"\
"set pgp_sign_as=0x20E638A0;set signature=~/.signature.d/itg.sig;"\
"set folder=~/Mail/Alphyra;set record=~/Mail/Alphyra/outbox;"\
"set postponed=~/Mail/Alphyra/postponed"

you could also do this with send hooks. i use them to tweak gpg settings:

send-hook ."unset pgp_autoencrypt;set pgp_autosign"
send-hook (ilug|webdev|social)@linux.ie\
"unset pgp_autosign;unset pgp_autoencrypt"

and then i have an include file with all people who have keys.
