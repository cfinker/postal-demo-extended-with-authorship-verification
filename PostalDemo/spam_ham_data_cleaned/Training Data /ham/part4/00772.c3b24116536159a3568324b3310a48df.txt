Despite being the author of SpamAssassin, I've never fixed exmh to do
this. I am therefore clearly not an exmh hacker ;)

But to simplify -- the first action is piping the message to an external
command, then replacing the message file with the output; and the second
is simply piping the message to another command, then ignoring the output.
I'd say it's easy enough to do, if someone can provide the tcl.
