I thought I baked my Dell PowerEdge 1400SC server yesterday
when it refused to boot completely. I borrowed a data vac
from a friend and decided to clean all of the dust and cat
hair from my systems, then after reconnecting everything,
the server would boot to the initial splash screen, where
there is a POST progress bar, but would not proceed past
past about the first 1/5th of the bar. Uh-oh. What did I
fry?

As it turns out, it was another case of "always check the
small stuff". Oh, I had all of the cables plugged back in to
the server properly, I checked all of that, but it didn't
dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later that
I should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the
cables. That server is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM
switch and with all of the yanking, plucking and shuffling,
the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the switch just a
tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning
message like every other computer on the planet, I can only
attribute to the BIOS developers. Server Satchel, running
Red Hat Linux 7.2 is now operating as it was previously. The
penguin is happy. The server case is even black. How
appropriate...

See You in August, Randy Nieland

Windows XP Security Checklist
Finely crafted by Bernie Klinder

http://www.labmice.net/articles/winxpsecuritychecklist.htm

With all of the security features crammed into Windows XP,
where does one start? Do you need VPN capability? Is NTFS an
appropriate file system choice for you? Is there any value
at all in Simple File Sharing? After much hounding, Bernie
Klinder has drawn up a healthy checklist of things you need
to address under Windows XP in order to maintain a system
that is both security and compatible with the rest of your
computing world.

ATI Still Makes Video Cards?

http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1656

Say it isn't so! Yes, apparently they do still have
something to say about NVIDIA's dominance in the video card
market. Seeing as how they've been all but dumped by the
majority of top-tier system makers, it's hard to believe
that they are capable of a serious comeback. Judging from
what AnandTech has to say about the forthcoming R300-based
cards, it appears that they haven't thrown in the towel just
yet. I'm all for competition, so I welcome the effective re-
entrance into the high end market. Let's all hope that their
driver development has improved as much as their hardware
seems to have.

Technical Censorship

http://news.com.com/2100-1023-944315.html

Odd. I liked that cup of Mocha (spelled M-O-C-H-A and I'll explain in a minute) I drank at Starbucks when Jake and I visited last week, but if I wanted to relay that to someone using a Yahoo email account, you might see an alternate word. Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of you using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and the word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in drinks. They've also had a terrible time interpretting our W3C standardized HTML lately, dropping in copious #message references throughout the text in their new Beta email client. So why the text replacement? It's another filtering technique to stop certain words that might relate to JavaScript functions. I guess I'll have to choose another beverage next time. Silly me.

Yer Kidding... Really?

http://www.theregus.com/content/4/25629.html

I'm all sorts of sarcastic today, aren't I? Those of us
that have had to manage budgets are used to dealing with
math in terms of hardware, software, maintenance and
personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's
certainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of
Linux on a server with less hardware requirements just to do
some file sharing, printing and maybe an Intranet page or
three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very long last,
Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to
point out that they have much more to offer than Linux,
which may indeed be true. But at the end of the day, when
you compare donuts to donuts and like functions against one
another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained
staff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge,
requiring additional training, suffer the odd blunder here
and there, and be less forgiving when it comes to detailed
configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use
Windows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a
replacement. Cheap is in the budget of the beholder.
