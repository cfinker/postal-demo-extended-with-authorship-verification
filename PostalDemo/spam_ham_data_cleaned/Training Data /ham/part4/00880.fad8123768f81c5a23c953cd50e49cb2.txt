Yeah, right. Considering the Genesis project just won an award for
figuring out (surprise, surprise) that N-body problems with 10+ bodies
yield some interesting synergetic surprises ... suffice it to say
that the issue has been hashed over in sci.astro many, many times,
since even long before Hollywood posed the problem, and the very best
advice is still "duck and cover"; if you are still going to nudge
anything, though, I'd nudge the rock (the one the size of a small
town) as you're less likely to re-define global agriculture that way.

'Course, you're gonna have this problem of distributing the force over
a large enough surface area that it translates into a resillient
compression wave instead of a knifeblade/diamond faultline split.
It's also not a game of billiards, but a 6+ dimensional collision
problem (space, time, spin, temp, maybe electromag too if there's any
heavy metals in it, and there often is) complete with relativistic
effects and everything. Hands up all those with experience subjecting
blackboxed alien geology to sustained forces in excess of 100 megatons
(10% of it's own momentum). I'm going to trust the US Army with this
when they can't even /find/ more than a few hundred Al Queda in a
desert?

Oh, another problem: It's not the only rock out there. We're just
getting better at spotting them.

Tell ya what: when you cowboys do get ready to bally-hootin' out to
blow-er-up-real-good, you let me know, eh, so I can move the the next
solar system before you do.
