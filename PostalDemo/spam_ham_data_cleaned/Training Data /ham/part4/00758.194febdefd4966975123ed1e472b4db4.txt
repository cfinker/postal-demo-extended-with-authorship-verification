There was also an interface called plum, but I was never able to get it
to work on the platform I was using in those days (SGI). Since plum
was written for perl4, it would probably need a major overhaul to work
well with modern Perl. It's pretty ugly code, too, being written by
Tom Christiansen. :-)
