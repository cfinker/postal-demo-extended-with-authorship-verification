Microsoft unbundles directory technology

Pittman set to leave AOL Time Warner

AOL Time Warner is expected to announce after the stock markets close Thursday that embattled chief operating officer Robert Pittman will relinquish his role as the media behemoth's No. 2 executive, according to a source close to the company.
