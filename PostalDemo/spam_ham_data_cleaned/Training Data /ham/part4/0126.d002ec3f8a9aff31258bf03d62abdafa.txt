Hackers and crackers respect only one thing: strong security. Keep the bad guys out of your PC or network with the advanced technology that's trusted by millions: ZoneAlarm Pro 3.0. This best-in-class personal firewall stops hackers cold, defends your online privacy,and sets up in minutes. Click here to download now!

Listen to Lockergnomie Dale Lowery and you'll save time
immediately. It's an old tip, but it bears repeating: "I'll often
find Web snippets I'd like to keep - but I don't want to save the
entire page. So, I've HOT-KEYED Notepad. Easy! Get to the most
common Notepad shortcut icon: Start | Programs | Accessories |
Notepad. Then right-click on the menu item and select Properties.
You'll see that this is (indeed) a shortcut; in the lower part of
the dialog is a field to add a hotkey. I entered 'N' for Notepad,
Windows offered CTRL and ALT as a prefix, and now I can launch
Notepad in an instant. I highlight the text I want to keep, copy
it, tap my shortcut, paste it, and then save the new text file
wherever I want. Most often, I use this trick to copy paragraphs
that describe downloads (and save them as text files in the same
folder as the download)." Just make sure you don't pick a keyboard
shortcut that's already in use. Otherwise, one of them is gonna
get cranky.

And while we're taking a trip down memory lane, Lockergnomie Ian
Rich reminds us of Jouni Vuorio's utility: The site is
jv16.org. The program is called
jv16 Power Tools, and this freeware is truly worthy of praise. It
combines a full-on registry management tool with several file
manager tools: one to hunt down temporary files in any format and
the other to help perform advanced file searches and comparisons.
Mainly, I wanted the program to be brought to the attention of the
consumer public, as it moves further and further along in
development it just keeps getting better. I've used it on windows
Me, and now XP - without crashes or hair-raising Registry
corruption. It backs up everything it changes and is very easy to
use. If you're interested in something of shareware-quality with
forum support (for absolutely nothing), get this program. Anyway,
I love the newsletter and the work you guys and gals do at
Lockergnome. I hope that this author gets his recognition."
Consider this a huge nod!

I love a good resource, and Lockergnomie Elton Jonsson from the
United Kingdom has one for us, too: "As a dedicated subscriber, I
just had to tell about this one. Have you ever been driven mad
trying to find out the name of the piece of music on a television
advert? Well, at last, here in the UK, we have an answer to that
problem and, given that many multinationals use the same
advertising in the USA as they do here, it may help out you guys
as well. Check out Commercial
Breaks and Beats. I have no connection with it; I'm just
grateful that someone has had the brilliant idea of creating it.
If you check the message board on the site, you'll see that I'm
not alone." This Google
Directory can help fill in the blanks, I'm sure. I
almost fell out of my chair the other day when I heard "Yeh Yeh"
(by TMBG) being played on a Chrysler advertisement. Way to go:
John, John, Dan, Dan, and Dan! You're the dogs kids love to bite.

And what's say we round out the report with another tip?
Lockergnomie David Brown can oblige: "The e-mail forwarding
service is a good idea, but you can do it yourself with Outlook
Express. Set up two accounts (one for your old account and one for
your new one). Craft your reply in a new message and save it.
Then, select Tools | Message Rules | Mail | New rule. Check 'Where
the message is from specified account' in the first section.
'Reply with message" in section two. Select the appropriate
account and message in the final section. Name it. You can also
have the messages flagged or moved to another folder if you want
to know which messages came from the old account. Once the rule
has been created, any mail from the old account will have a reply
sent. People should learn about mail rules, anyway." True! So,
what rule simplifies your day?

See You in August, Chris Pirillo

QuicKalendar v1.0.2 [430k] W9x/2k/XP FREE

http://www.trinfinitysoftware.com/quickalendar.shtml

{Calendar utility} You say you want to get together on the 25th, but what DAY is that? I'm not good with calendar dates; truth be told, I don't even know what day of the week it is most the time. If I didn't have my PDA armed with a Calendar with me, then I wouldn't show up to anything on time, let alone on the right day. Well, that is great for when I am mobile, but what about when I am in front of my PC? The PDA is docked, but that doesn't mean I have to be without a calendar... enter QuicKalendar! "QuicKalendar gives you quick and easy access to a calendar whenever you need it. You can view the calendar on screen, or print it out to jot down notes and appointments." You need to keep in mind that the print feature is relative to how you have QuicKalendar displayed on your machine. If you are in full screen mode, then the printout will be bigger than a standard sheet of letter paper. If you try printing in normal view, then the printout will be too small to write on. My suggestion is to play with the size of QuicKalendar's screen until you get a printout that you can be proud of. Now, you'll have no reason to be late for Gnomedex!

Diatris v1.0 [407k] W9x/2k/XP FREE

http://www.webruler.com/mtreciokas/

{Tetris-like game} I've always been fascinated with geometric shapes. To me everything has to be somewhat symmetrical... even my hair! So it was no wonder why I was addicted to playing the game Tetris for so many years. The only problem with Tetris is that, after awhile, it starts to get a little too easy. Diatris is a bundle of three different - and much more challenging - Tetris-like games. "For the first game, Y-Diatris, the objects can move vertically and diagonally. The second game, X-Diatris, the objects can move only in two diagonal directions; the vertical drop is taken out. For the last game H-Diatris the objects can only move vertically and horizontally like most block drop games." I won't kid you, these games can be pretty hard, but if you are a Tetris fan, then these set of games are for you. If you're not a Tetris fan, don't worry, there are a few other games you might like on this site, so check it out!

How to Troubleshoot Issues with Reading CDs

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q321641

{Disc device troubleshooting} "This article describes how you can troubleshoot issues reading CD-ROM or DVD-ROM optical discs. This article also discusses how to troubleshoot common issues with CD-R and CD-RW devices. The steps in this article apply to compact disc (CD-ROM) drives, compact disc recordable (CD-R) drives, compact disc re-writable (CD-RW) drives, and digital video disc (DVD) drives." To summarize, you should try the steps on this site before calling your technical support. Some of the steps include closing unnecessary software, testing the disc in a different computer, and cleaning the disc. Make sure to clean a disc by wiping from the center of the disc outward... if you wipe the disc in a circular fashion, then you risk scratching it. The steps in this article will only serve to save you time, as you will probably be able to fix most disc problems by following the steps. If this article doesn't help you resolve your disc problem, look on the bright side... you won't have to spend so much time on the phone with technical support, because you'll already know what the problem ISN'T!

Modem Spy v3.1.3b [230k] W9x/2k/XP $25
Unearthed by Sergei Polishchuk

http://www.modemspy.com/

{Answering machine} "Modem spy is a handy utility for phone calls recording. Features: 1) Records phone conversations. 2) Records from microphone. 3) Plays back recorded messages via phone line. 4) Plays back recorded messages via sound card. 5) Can record ALL incoming phone calls. 6) Has built-in software automatic gain control. 7) Detects and logs Caller ID." Gnomie Brian Stevens tried this one out for us, but had a small problem testing this on any of his machines... he doesn't have any modems! Brian says, "I was able to load the program, though, and try a few of the features out. You can record an audio memo to your machine, much like an answering machine. You can also e-mail this audio memo, although I don't recommend you do that as the WAV file didn't seem to play well when I tried e-mailing it to myself (which may have been due to the microphone it was recorded with). Other than that, Modem Spy is a solid program and is a great alternative to buying a traditional answering machine... plus in most cases it is cheaper!" Keep in mind that, for Caller ID to work, you need the Caller ID service turned on by your phone service provider.

The Avocado Papers
Unearthed by Meryl Evans

http://www.theavocadopapers.com/

After surfing serious Web site upon serious Web site, you just need to find a site where you can relax and have a good time. TheAvocadoPapers.com is one of those sites that is a little bit goofy but extremely creative. It isn't that the Web site is really about anything; there is some creative writing (usually rather funny) and the occasional interview (this week "Steve Schneider Interviews Himself"). If you are a little bit nosy, and want to peek into the lives of others, you can read Ron Bork's diary or enter the Avocado Chat. Although the makers of the Web site don't even know what it is about, I think it is quite apparent... fun! Go check out the Web site for yourself and see if you can pin down its rhyme or reason. Worst-case scenario, you can always sign up for their current promotion... free linguine!

GnomeTIP

This tip is for the Windows XP users out there. "The Windows XP operating system achieves excellent performance in part by dynamic adjustments that it makes in response to how a system is utilized. In particular, many adjustments are made when the system first runs following setup and when newly installed applications are used for the first time. These adjustments greatly influence the performance of the system. Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of Windows XP can make benchmarking more of a challenge than with previous Windows versions." To properly benchmark your Windows XP system, there are a few steps you should follow. The step with which we are concerned in this particular tip is letting your PC process any "idle tasks." Idle tasks are tasks that your PC executes when it deems the system to be unused or idle. Some of these include file placement optimization, system restore, and done-once-after-setup work items. "All of these 'idle tasks' are controllable by a system API in advapi32.dll, ProcessIdleTasks. The API's sole purpose is to allow benchmarks a simple way to force any pending idle tasks to be executed immediately, without having to wait a lengthy period of time. To call ProcessIdleTasks from the command line, use this syntax: Rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks." Once running, it may take up to around 15 minutes to process all of the idle tasks, and your hard drive will be active through most of it. For more steps on preparing your Windows XP machine for benchmarking, head over to the Windows Platform Development page on Benchmarking for Windows XP on Microsoft's site.
