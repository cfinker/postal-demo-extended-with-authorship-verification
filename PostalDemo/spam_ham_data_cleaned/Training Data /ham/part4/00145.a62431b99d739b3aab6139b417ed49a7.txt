i can read it fine. :)

if you want readability - a good script is worth just as much.

ah doh! yes.

i thought the firewalling code on all the BSDs was fairly related -
sorry. So FreeBSD's ipfw is not encumbered in the same way the old
OBSD firewalling was?

to an extent, i guess so, yes. but i've a few boxes with reasonable
uptimes that run netfilter/iptables. (i've one that has crashed twice
now after 60+ day uptimes. but that doesnt seem to be netfilter).

course, there's a lot more that can go wrong with a firewall than the
firewall code. in that case get 2 boxes and heartbeat them.

indeed. couldnt agree more.

(that's the nice thing about *nix - fact we /can/ have nit-picking
arguments about which *nix and firewall code is better).

i've no experience of ipfw. (closest i've come is looking at IPFilter
for IRIX - but it had a problem in that it wasnt maintained
anymore. however, while the englishy syntax is nice, i dont think
iptables command syntax is a big obstacle).

anyway.. there's choice. and as i understand it, with the advent of
netfilter/iptables there's now almost nothing between them from a
technical POV. (apart from ipfw being in use a lot longer).
