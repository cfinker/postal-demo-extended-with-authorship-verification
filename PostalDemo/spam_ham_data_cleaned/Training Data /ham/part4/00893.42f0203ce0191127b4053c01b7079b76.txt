Has anyone considered the fact that these occurrances appear to
be increasing. I'm aware that maybe more publicity surrounding
some and certain agencies have been granted more funding, but
I'd like to see some data which shows if these are increasing
or not.

Why? Well, it seems to me if we were going to get hit, the one
that does it may have been part of a larger swarm or cluster
which has over the years increased the distance between the
rocks. Like the Schumaker Levy-9, which had multiple rocks
all impacting at different times, others may have this same
type of design and could be in different stages of increasing
distance from one another. Also to consider is if SL-9 was
on course for earth, would we get hit by all rocks or only
one because the earth is a much smaller target than Jupiter?

So, my theory is that if these near earth rocks are increasing
so does our chance of discovering the last three were part of
a swarm of 15 of which 10, 11 and 12 may hit.
