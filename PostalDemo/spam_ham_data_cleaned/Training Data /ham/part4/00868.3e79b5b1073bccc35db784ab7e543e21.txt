Thats where the gentic Purists bredding program was heading. Hitler wet
himslef when his big brains laid out the plan of forced natural selection,
images of strong young blonde boys marching around him sent him off in a
double nostil coke blow frenzy..

Of course back then they did not have the fine tuned maps we got today.
Macromap wise we got the host of gps angles over head beaming the answeres
in feet to our "where are we now" musings, micromap wise we now have the
ability to spot the "will laugh at the goon shows" switch"

All the early genticpurists had to go on was hkull size, hair color and
schlongalongadingdangage.

AS always the probelm is not that we can do this , its what we do with it.
