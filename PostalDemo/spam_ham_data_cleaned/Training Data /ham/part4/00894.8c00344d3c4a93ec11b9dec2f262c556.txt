We hope that in the next generation we can bring back what we once thought
of as our future, or more aptly thier future will be a shade better than
what ours is turning out to be.

I cant help but appologise to my wifes bulging middle in these last few
dyas of the pregancy. I wanted so much more for him. My daughter and I
talk about this in the ways an 8 year old can with a 39 year old. She
realizes things are not all they could have been, but shes sort of ready
for the challange. She told me the other day she would get to the moon if
I dont. Gota love kids, they say the coolest things at just the right
times.

As for profit and the drive towars it...moeny is simply a tool,simply one
way of many to facilitate living the life you want. Too many have taken
the tool for the goal, the race for the prize and the notion that first is
all.

Yea yea, this sad burlesque.
