>> MINI NEWS > TRACKING > if they'd used the proper mathematical sigma symbol in
the title, then the sequel could have been called "The
Derivative Of Distress - With Respect To Terror" for largely
humourless feelgood nuclear thriller THE SUM OF ALL FEARS
( http://www.screenit.com/movies/2002/the_sum_of_all_fears.html :
We see [Bridget "Coyote Ugly" Moynahan] in bed, showing some
cleavage; the camera briefly focuses on some cheerleaders'
clothed butts during the Super Bowl)... oh and it's the full
release this week for SPY KIDS 2: THE ISLAND OF LOST DREAMS
( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/spykids2.htm : telepathy;
pelvic thrusts by a child; drinking with multiple drugging;
"Let's kick their [posteriors]" - which is not included in the
list of three/four letter word vocabulary but is impudent;
toilet humor - smothering in a pile of dung with fecal matter
in mouth)...

CONFECTIONERY THEORY>> "Are you tracking breakfast cereal?"
inquired a concerned LLOYD WOOD, after recently wandering into
the "kiddy end" of the cereal aisle. "They've all gone CD-ROM
on the front", he observed - causing him, for a moment to
think he was looking at "some really bloated computer
magazines". Of course we are, Lloyd, though we're not as
easily swayed by gimmicks as you are, and thus can impartially
report that NESTLE's Maryland-style COOKIE CRISP are the most
biscuit-like breakfast ever, easily triumphing over KELLOGG's
FROSTIES CHOCOLATE (too much chocolate, not enough "frosty"),
COCO POPS CRUNCHERS (clump together in this humid weather) and
even the Winnie The Pooh-themed DISNEY HUNNY B's - and if you
mix them all together, the milk goes so chocolatey it'll turn
your Pooh brown... elsewhere in dairy, MCDONALD'S continue a
disappointing run of toppings for the MCFLURRY (99p) -
Cadbury's Caramel is rubbish, and Jammie Dodgers not a patch
on our second-favourite McFlurry of all time, the Strawberry
Crunch: http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02001-08-10&l=286#l .
Reader ED AVIS complains that KFC don't tell you that their
"M&M" AVALANCHE (also 99p) does not feature real M&Ms but
"special miniaturised ones", which he describes as "frozen
solid" and "might as well be small bits of gravel for all the
chocolate flavour they impart". While, following last week's
announcement of Ice T's Posse Pops, CRAIG LEFF thought we'd be
reassured by the news that NBC are launching their own range
of TV-themed Baskin-Robbins ice-creams, including a "Fear
Factor" flavour designed to recreate the experience of eating
"dirt and spiders": http://www.adage.com/news.cms?newsId=35520
... back with confectionery, LEON VERRALL remained unimpressed
with STARBURST FRUITINESSE (from 49p, "tasted of plastic...
[resembled] those 'food pills' they thought we'd all be eating
by now"), DAVID BLANE grudgingly approved of the TWIX TRIPLE
CHOC LIMITED EDITION ("Not bad, faintly evoking Penguins,
which I never liked because of the thick chocolate"), and the
whole point of that controversial "It's not for girls"
campaign was revealed: to position NESTLE DOUBLE CREAM (40p)
as a more female-friendly version of the YORKIE BAR. Other
treats to look forward to in coming weeks: Cola-flavoured
CADBURY-TREBOR REFRESHERS, chicken-wings-flavoured HULA HOOPS,
bacon QUAVERS, the (presumably) non-crisp-like GOLDEN WONDER
FRUIT WONDERS - or, indeed, any of this weird new American
stuff: http://www.candyusa.org/Press/New/ace2002.shtml ,
ranging from SCORNED WOMAN CHOCOLATE JALAPENO FUDGE to SOFT
AND CHEWY STINKY FEET ("Mmm, these feet are *so* stinky")...
