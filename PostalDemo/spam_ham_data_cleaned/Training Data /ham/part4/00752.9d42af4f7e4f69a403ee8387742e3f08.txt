Yet another pre-interview query. I don't know a thing about them that
isn't on their mostly-uninformative web site. Charles River Ventures led
a $10 million round of financing in January of this year.

One of their techie founders wrote a paper on a protocol to allow
out-of-order image chunk delivery for image types that can be rendered
that way.
