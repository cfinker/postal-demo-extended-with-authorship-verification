Soros, in _Open Society_, says he
has a theory that the coevolutionary
nature of finance and history mean
they are subject to many boom-bust
cycles. As a result of having some
leisure time after playing them so
successfully with Quantum Fund, he
now believes that we need to keep
our strategies as game players and
rule makers distinct: the ends of
rule makers can't be so strictly
personal as those of game players.

Do the cardinal virtues provide a
set of restoring forces which allow
one to act in balance?

temperance - avoid hubris in booms
fortitutude - avoid depression in busts
prudence - maximize personal utility (as a game player)
justice - maximize common good (as a rule maker)
