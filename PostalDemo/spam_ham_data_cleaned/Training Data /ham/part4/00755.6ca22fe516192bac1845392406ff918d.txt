Last week I had a chance to see some TabletPC's demonstrated, and I was very
impressed.

* Handwriting recognition was good, as was the ability to parse text from
diagrammatic or graphic elements.
* TabletPC form factors, while not perfect, are quite usable (light,
relatively thin, some can convert from laptop to tablet use by flipping the
screen).
* Pushbutton switching between portrait and landscape screen orientation.
* TabletPCs I saw came with built-in WiFi.
* Good to very good integration of handwriting into existing applications,
and there is a very nice new note-taking application specifically for
handwritten notes.
* Good set of APIs for adding handwriting into existing applications (at the
most simple, it's only a few additional lines of code)
* Prices of the hardware will be around mid-range laptop (will vary by
model)

I believe the TabletPC will be very successful, and is a much bigger deal
than the relative lack of press coverage would suggest. I'm definitely
starting to think about how I could incorporate one into my routine...
