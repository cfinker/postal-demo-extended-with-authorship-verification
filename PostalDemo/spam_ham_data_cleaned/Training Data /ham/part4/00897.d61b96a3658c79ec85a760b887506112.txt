To actually answer the question, each of the last three reports was
hurling down a different "tube" so, no, they are not related, but yes,
each tube contains an uneven distribution of stuff that only /peaks/
near the biggest chunks. It would actually be pretty amazing to find
any repeat visitor still in one piece after it's solar perigee. Space
in that neighbourhood is warped like a cheese-grater. We can expect
one (or more) really big mother(s), surrounded by lots of cute little
'uns smeared out in the crest of its gravity wave.

Another curious artifact of the old-and-periodic rock data is the
bigger rocks are on the outer edge of the tubes: Relativistic effects
on the redshift/blueshift of the particle solar heating differential
on either side of each bit slow the smaller less-massive (and more
easily pushed) particles dropping them into lower orbits ... or at
least, that's our best theory.
