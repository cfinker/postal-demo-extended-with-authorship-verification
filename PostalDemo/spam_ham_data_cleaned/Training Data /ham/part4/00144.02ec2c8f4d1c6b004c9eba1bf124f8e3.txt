TextAloud MP3 converts text to speech and to MP3
Listen to email, Web pages, e-books, and more on your PC or
portable MP3 player. As featured in PC Magazine, The New
York Times, and on CNN. Now available with optional
AT&T Natural Voices, the most advanced computer speech for your PC.
Listen to a demo, then
download your trial copy.

Lockergnome's Guide to Converting Vinyl LPs to CD is no longer free.
Over the last 10 days, almost 4,000 people downloaded the free tome.
Of that 4,000, close to half put in a fake e-mail address, resulting
in a ridiculous number of bounce messages in my inbox. Add to that
the fact that several of the clever individuals used other people's
real addresses, which then amounted to complaints of spam from the
address owners. It's not worth providing a free service if it causes
Lockergnome to be labeled a spammer as a result. The crowning gem was
the in-duh-vidual who used the name A** Hole and Chris's personal
address to download the PDF. On a more positive note, the guide is
now available in all six formats,
for the minimal price of $5, complete with some additional content
based on a couple reader suggestions.

Chris may have an obsession with Peets coffee, but I'll bet he's never
been the daily special. On my visit to St. Louis, for the
SIC, I
started every morning with a walk to the West Port Starbucks.
Apparently my morning ritual was a source of entertainment for the
employees, which evolved into discussions of a reality based TV show
based on the concept of stalking me. I've even got the
incriminating evidence
to prove it.

The SIC provided me the opportunity to see some cool updates to a couple
titles, in addition to being introduced to some useful audio oriented
titles I'd never seen before. Expect a number of reviews over the next
several weeks, as well as extensive coverage of last week's events in
St. Louis in the annual SIC special issue. Lori managed to score a few
more Gnomedex giveaways while we were in attendance, so those of you who
sign up will be coming home with even more goodies, which, by the way,
aren't of the stressball and pen variety -- we're talking software
titles with reg codes.

DreamQuest Championship Card Games
For Pocket PC, Palm, Symbian OS

http://www.dq.com/palm.html

Playing games on a PDA has killed plenty of my time spent waiting in
airports around the US. With the recent porting of these three classic
PC card games from DreamQuest, I've added some of the best in PC
entertainment to my arsenal of PDA diversions. Hearts, Spades and Euchre
all play in a similar manner to their PC versions, only on a smaller
screen. Available for Pocket PC, Palm, and even the Symbian OS, you can
play cards against computer opponents or connect to the online game room
and challenge other players using any of the games multiple platforms.
This is a unique experience currently unavailable for any other pocket games.

Rexway

http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/56/rexway.html

Blending punk rock attitude with country twang makes for a fairly
unique musical experience. I saw these guys play a show in Omaha,
back in January of this year and was blown away by their stage
presence. Rexway rip through an opening set with enough energy to
kick-start even the most somber crowd, moving everyone in the
audience to their feet and setting the scene for an entertaining
evening. As with most punk, the lyrics are equal parts politics
and angst, with enough colorful language to drop a jaw or two.
Tool fans should check out the countrified version of the classic
HWAP; it's kind of like a cover tune, only more unique. If you
are offended by 4-letter words, this band isn't for you.

Croupier (NR) 1998
Drama - 94min
Reviewer's Tilt (9)

Special DVD Features worth a look-Deleted scenes

In disembodied first person Clockwork style narration, Croupier
pessimistically compares our lives to those of hapless casino gamblers.
We know the odds are stacked against us, yet we continue to play the
games. Gamblers, or "punters" as they are more derogatorily known,
however, play their games under the watchful eyes of the croupier
(casino dealer). Constantly pulled by the siren song of fast money, the
croupier knows better than anyone that to play is to lose. Thus, the
cool croupier relegates himself to his addiction of watching others
lose. Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is the croupier, raised by his croupier
father (Nicholas Ball) who taught him all the tricks of the trade.
Through his losses both in the casino and in his personal life, Jack's
father also taught Jack that the only way to win is not to play. Punters
are sorry sods; the croupier is king. From father to son, the lesson
passes -- watching others strive and falter is the only real enjoyment
in life. Despite decades of croupier training, Jack is compelled to
write the great novel burning deep inside him, yearning to escape.
Jack's publisher regrettably relates to Jack that his novel idea is
trite; stories of real life graft and corruption are what sell. When
Jack's father informs Jack of a casino opening in a small London Casino,
Jack snatches the opportunity to parlay his skill into a novel exposing
the seedy underbelly of London's casinos. Unfortunately, Jack's ex-cop
girlfriend sees the job hardening and irreparably changing Jack for the
worst. In an attempt to fool himself, Jack creates alter ego "Jake" to
bear the brunt of inequity, attempting to maintain Jack both morally and
physically unscathed. The absence of any clear delineation between the
personas becomes apparent when a lovely punter (Alex Kingston)
approaches Jack with a scheme to rob the casino. Jack slowly comes to
the realization that no one can have it both ways, either in the casino
or in life. You are either in the game, or you are not. Seasoned veteran
director Michael Hodges deftly crafts this tale around the subtle
talents of the ultra cool Clive Owen. Owen rules this drama, not with
flex and volume, but with glances and nods. Less is truly more, much
more, in this low budget escape from the unsatisfying blockbuster
suspense films of recent memory. Croupier proves that it is not a large
budget, but direction, dialogue and acting that drive the genre.
