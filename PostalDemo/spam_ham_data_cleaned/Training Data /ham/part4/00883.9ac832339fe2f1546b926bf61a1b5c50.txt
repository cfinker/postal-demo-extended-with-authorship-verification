Hey, that thing is 2 km across and 28 km/s fast. There's nothing you can
do just before the impact with a system that was designed to deal with
tiny ballistic missiles, and largely by damaging them, not destroying
them. Apart from twiddling with the surface albedo which might be not
enough -- we currently don't have ion drives with enough power, or at
least we can't develop and deploy them on time, so that only leaves you
with nukes. Assymetrical repeated flash-evaporation (anything closer would
risk fragmenting it) on rocks of unknown composition (could be a pile of
rubble for all what we know) has never been tried yet, though.

It is much more interesting whether you can kill enough of delta v for a
capture. But here trying to brake a smaller object (say, few 100 m across)
with final stage aerobraking would be far more useful. Otoh, one could as
well could invest that effort into a launch capacity on the Moon.
