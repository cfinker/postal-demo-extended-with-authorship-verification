I'm positive some of you folks have done this, so perhaps someone can just
drop me a pointer to where it's already been discussed?

In particular, I was going to have a menu entry available for:

o remove the SA markup from a message
o add/remove addresses to whitelist

Help! :-) I've never done customization of this type to my exmh install.
I'm running version 2.4 (6/23/2000) on RedHat 7.3
