Same here. My folks were both born and raised in a blue color section of
the Bronx. I was raised in the same Apt my dad was raised in...a tiny one
bedroom place.

Both my folks got educated and moved away from the lifestyle of "in da
poor trenches 4 life"

Yep. I wached as my dad went for his GED then his Bachelors and so on. I
watched as both he and my mom worked hard to get out of the place they
were. Once thing it taught me, its tough work but if you havea goal then
its worth it.

Its that language thing again. Rich is a very vast word, its like Salt. If
you put it on steak its going to taste differnt then if you season pasta
with it.

Us Vs THEM, its ages old and the power structures inately know that to
keep things goign there way folks need, NEED..heck DEMAND the US vs THEM
strugle. So its the Wealthy VS the Poor...the Smart Vs the Stupid...the
With vs the Withouts....and all the while those shmucks who go underdog
down trodden need only get out of the loop and play a differnt game.
