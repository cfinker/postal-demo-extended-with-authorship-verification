I don't know Mutt, to be honest, but the KDE mail client "KMail" can
do this very neatly - you set up multiple "Identity" profiles, each
with a distinct email address (and other things if desired, like a GPG
key and a signature). You can then set up KMail to use various
identities automatically when replying to messages which match a
particular pattern, or which are in a particular folder, etc. It's
all very cool, and it works very nicely.

But I still don't know how to do it in Mutt.

A dirty mind is a terrible thing to waste.
