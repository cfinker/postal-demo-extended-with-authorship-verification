Through daily use I've found that Mozilla and Opera Web browsers beat Internet Explorer because of two features: tabbed windows and built-in pop-up killers. But occasionally I hit a site that has features that don't work or has a messed up layout, so I have to launch IE to view it correctly. In the last couple of years, Web builders have used proprietary code from Microsoft in their sites, which Mozilla and Opera don't support.

I used to cover Web building, so I have plenty of insight into the problem. Using current, standard HTML and JavaScript, Web builders can make a Web site do almost anything that you could with Microsoft's proprietary code. The only things they can't do are goofy enhancements such as changing the browser scroll bar colors. To solve this compatibility problem, either Web builders have to take proprietary tags out of their sites or users have to use IE to view them. You can also enhance IE with utilities such as Secure IE to get the kinds of features offered by Mozilla and Opera, giving you the best of both worlds.

Who do you think should be solving problems of Web site incompatibility: Web builders, users, or browser manufacturers? Let me know at edit@download.com.

Surely, the folks who run your ISP have thought long and

hands and shows you how to protect yourself.

Apple's lovely little MP3 player, you're in luck. Not one
but two software apps bring iPod compatibility to your
FireWire-equipped PC. EphPod and XPlay square off in this
battle of cross-platform compatibility.

Last week I asked whether Audiogalaxy could survive only offering non-infringing files. Here are a few of your answers:

"Doomed. Completely, absolutely, utterly!"
Just about everyone agreed that Audiogalaxy is as dead as Napster.

"Each time a file-sharing service is canceled, a bunch of new ones appear."
But some people always find a silver lining.

"I might use a file-sharing service for a lot of things, particularly drivers, fixes, and patches."
A P2P network offering drivers seems like a great idea to me.

"I was an occasional Audiogalaxy participant (birthday CD burned to include songs that were hits the year you were born). Now I'll just opt for a birthday card and a bottle of wine."
I included this comment because I really like the birthday idea.

"It seems once again rather than release a file download site for music, at a fee per download, the music companies spend money on trying to stop download sites like Audiogalaxy."
With its popularity, file swapping should be an amazing opportunity for record companies, but they must not be smart enough to figure out how to make it work.
