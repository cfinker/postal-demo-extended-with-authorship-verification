You're a good bunch, you Penguins.

Today's GnomeVOICE really tells the story better than I can, but I'll give you a

quick summary. Through your efforts and compassion, reader Karl Steenblik has
found a new electronic home for the Foundation for Children and Youth With
Diabetes. I'll let Karl tell you which offered solution suited his needs. But,
with the volume of responses his request for help generated, it's almost
irrelevant. As I expected, we came together as a community and collectively
offered him many viable choices from which to pick a solution that would work
for the kids. The global scope of your concern and our collective ability to
effect a change has humbled me once again. Just when you start to get a little
callous about the 'Net ...

Accordingly, I'd like to sketch out an idea with you that can be an ongoing part

of Penguin Shell. It's an open discussion, really, about how we can further put
our technical skills (be they Linux or Windows skills) to work for a good

cause. I'm proposing that we start an organized volunteer effort, based in the
Penguin Shell readership, to provide volunteer technical services to worthwhile
charitable organizations. First, we need a name that clearly describes our purpose. Next, we need
volunteers with the time and ability to lend those skills to a good cause. Finally, we'll need some suggestions as to
the charitable organizations that are near and dear to your heart. Or,

maybe the organization is one you're already working with - one you're certain
can use some hands-on or remote volunteer help.

I'll start that ball rolling with a personal organizational suggestions - the Aicardi Syndrome Foundation.
Though I don't currently know their technical needs, I do know that the syndrome

is very rare - read "research and technical dollars are minimal." I'm sure we
can, as a group, provide them a way to fill existing technical holes.

That's just a suggestion. Feel free to use the mailto links above to make
others.

Over the next few weeks, I plan on modifying my current favorite blogging
program, GeekLog
to pull together a community project area where interested parties can gather,
coordinate and discuss whatever this project might become. I'll keep you posted
on the details.

In one of the earliest issues of Penguin Shell, I told a story about Emperor
Penguins - how they huddle together on the shore, knowing that their protection
from predators lies in sheer numbers. When one takes the leap into the water,
all the others follow; individual involvement for the good of the community.

Where could the analogy possibly be more fitting?

Quick Shortcuts

Linux is chock full of keyboard shortcuts that, when used, streamline the way
you use your system. Today's Tweaks are really user tweaks - built in shortcuts
you can use to maximize your Linux efficiency. You don't have to change your
system, just how you use what's already there. They're two tips that are quick
and very easy to learn and remember.

Got a cluttered console screen? Use [ctrl]+l to clear it. This does the
same thing as the clear command with far fewer keystrokes.

Do you want to log out of the console screen quickly? Use the [ctrl+d key

combination. This will log out the current user. If you're using bash and the
current user is not root, the [ctrl]+d combination will close the terminal
window, as well.

To me, any opportunity to save keystrokes is a good one. Better yet, if I can
avoid having to take my fingers from the keyboard to reach for the mouse, then
I've really saved some time. Though it's tough to quantify the time savings
using these keystroke combination shortcuts, intuitively I can tell you it's
substantial.

Maximum efficiency. That's what Tweaks are all about.

Kernel Configuration - Part XI

We've covered some fairly light topics to this point in the kernel configuration

series. Today's topic requires a bit of review. We'll discuss configuring block
devices in your kernel.

We've talked about the different types of devices in previous Penguin Shell
issues. Fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and
character devices. These draw their type names from the way they handle data.
Block devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally pre-set sizes of
data "blocks." Hard drives are block devices. They'll only write chunks of data
to storage. Thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly. Data
intended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your power
dies or you hard kill your machine. The system may still be accumulating data up

to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive.

Character devices, on the other hand, receive data in "streams," one character
at a time. Serial ports are a great example of character devices. They handle
data input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer then
committing the data.

The physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining why
they handle data as they do. A hard drive has to physically spin up to store or
retrieve data. You're actually changing the magnetic properties of the disc
surface when you store data. Consequently, a hard drive has to know where
there's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the disc under
the write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related data
together.

Character devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and forget

about it. The process is purely electrical rather than electrical and physical.
The serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your Palm Pilot. The
storage of the data is actually handled by the Palm itself, not a physical
storage device on the computer. There's no need to spin up a drive and account
for the data as is necessary with a hard drive. The Palm will also send a signal

back to the computer confirming receipt of data. That's an indication that
character devices often communicate in both directions, as well.

So, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the
system for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a predetermined
level, then write that data as a block, changing the physical properties of the
hard drive disc surface. Even though that's the highest level view of the
process, it still shows how difficult a process physical data storage really
is.

In the block device section, you'll find many options for physical data storage.

When configuring this section, it's crucial to know as much about your existing
hardware as possible. What type (brand) of hard drives are you using? What's the

interface to the machine - IDE, parallel, etc? Where is the drive located - on
the local machine or on a network-connected box? Because the variables are so
broad, it's nearly impossible to give you a stock configuration tip that will
work for your personal machine every time. I can tell you this - you will have
block devices (normally a hard drive and a floppy), and you need to answer as
many of the above questions as you can. Find out as much about these physical
devices as you can, and the configuration process will be relatively
painless.

A warning - you'll see more configuration tips like this as the series continues

to progress. I'll certainly make hands-on configuration recommendations where
possible. There are quite a few areas where I can make such recommendations.
However, where the variable set is as broad as block devices, much of the
legwork will be up to you.

Tomorrow, we'll talk about RAID and multi-device support in Linux.

rxLinux

http://www.fusionw3.com/rxlinux/

"The concept behind rxlinux is to centralise configuration and management of
multiple Linux servers. New servers can be deployed in minutes. A Web interface
is used to build custom ISO CD-ROMs dedicated for specific servers. Servers,
also called rxnodes, boot up from that CD-ROM and get the rest of the
configuration and software from a master server. No administration is done
directly on the nodes; everything is controlled from the master servers. When
the rxnode has finished booting up and all software is running, it is completely

independent from the rxmaster until the next reboot."

Scribbled by Karl Steenblik

"I can not believe all of the help your posting to the Linux community has
generated. I have had over 20 offers for help. Some of the offers would
not fit our space needs but that number of responses shows that Linux
people care.

"I am overwhelmed with gratitude with Lockergnome and
http://digitaldaze.com/

"Bill at Digitaldaze has sent us a large gift of 100 MB of space. More
that I think we will ever use.

"I thank all of the people who offered help. There are more generous
people than I can type to individually. Our camp will hold Linux people
in the highest esteem and I will make sure Linux, Lockergnome, and
Digitaldaze have a prominent places on our site in the future.

"Soon you will be able to visit our new site at
http://fcyd.digitaldaze.com/.

"Now the work for me begins, moving the site! Oh the labors of love that
make us whole.

"Everyone have a super day.
