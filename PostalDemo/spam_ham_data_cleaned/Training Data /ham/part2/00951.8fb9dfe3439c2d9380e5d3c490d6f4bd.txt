Then again, if 57% of CEOs have the time to be as up on technology as
their CIO, either one or maybe even /both/ of them are maybe not doing
their job, and maybe that's yet another reason the dot-bubble burst.

Mind you, I've been head-butting with 'tech-expert' captains (and
cooks) all my life. It's probably my own damn fault for making what I
do /look/ so easy, and also probably why 'metal guitarists grimmace so
when playing a simple rubato ;)
