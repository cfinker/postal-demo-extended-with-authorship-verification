Until this patch, exmh was full of hardcoded references to unseen. One of the
things I did was to change these to look in the already available global
variable with the value in it (which other parts of the code did use).

Anyway, I've just fixed the performance problem with repeatedly reading the
sequences files. I'll patch it in after I've run it for a while.
