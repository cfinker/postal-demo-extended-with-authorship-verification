Brooklyn Bridge for sale! No kidding! The town of Brooklyn,
Iowa has a bridge that they are selling on Ebay, so if you have a need for such
a structure, or just want to have the right to say you
legitimately purchased the Brooklyn Bridge, here's your
opportunity! Seriously, this is not a prank!

Ever since I was down toward Des Moines last week and had
a cup-o-java with Jake at Starbucks, I've been craving
coffee. I can't see myself turning into a coffee junkie like
Chris, but it's just weird that this would happen, being
that my extent of coffee drinking has usually been limited
to the severe need for a quick morning wake-up or in an
effort to keep warm on cold mornings when out in the field
back in my Marine Corps days.

As time has gone on, I've been trying to cut back on the
typical geek vices of sugar and caffeine, but I can't drink
coffee straight. It has to be sweet, and what's the point of
drinking coffee if there's no caffeine? Enter Splenda. An
artificial sweetener that has finally made it to Waterloo,
Iowa. Most of what Diana and I use sugar for has been
modified to use Splenda instead, with good results.
Hopefully this coffee thing is just a temporary kick like it
usually is. I have to brush my teeth after a cup or two from
the nasty breath. It's fun to test out the dragon-breath on
the cat to see just how bad it really is. If Bootes sniffs a
couple of times, it's not too bad, but if she instantly
recoils, time to employ the Sonicare for a couple of
minutes. See what you've started, Jake?

See You in August, Randy Nieland

Exchange Titanium Details Emerge

http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/07-15exchangeqa.asp

Oracle recently announced their intention to compete
directly with Microsoft Exchange, even accepting Outlook as
an email client. In what seems like a direct response, we're
handed details of the 2003 release of Exchange Titanium.
I've always liked what Exchange can do, so I'm certainly
looking forward to seeing what the new features will be all
about, but I'm also interested in what Oracle will be
bringing to the table. Better email functionality, control
and security are the name of the game, whoever ends up being
the vendor of choice. Included in this Q&A is a screenshot
of what Outlook may look like once Office 11 is released.
It's an interesting concept shot, showing some new ways they
plan to handle email views. It doesn't say anything for
Exchange functionality, but it's worth noting regardless.

Better Pocket PC Audio
Unearthed by David Spencer

http://home.adelphia.net/~mdukette/downloads.html

An open source project is bringing a different spin to
audio and video on Pocket PCs, and my first impression is...
cool! I like what they're working on here. I decided to wipe
out my Jornada yesterday, so I haven't done a direct
comparison between the iPaq 3870 and Jornada 565 for audio
quality using this player, which has an equalizer built-in,
but it definitely has potential judging from how it sounds
on the iPaq right out of the gate. Definitely give this a
peek if you're one of those that likes to play audio and
video on a Pocket PC. Quite a few different versions are
supported, so you should be able to find something
appropriate to your device.

Where's Java?

http://news.com.com/2100-1001-944053.html

Three readers asked me about this very thing this week,
and it's something you should probably know about if you use
Windows XP. Microsoft didn't bundle the Java Virtual Machine
with Windows XP, and since the release of XP, the JVM has been avaialble via the
Windows Update site as a "convenience" to users. Part of Sun's legal
complaints surrounding how Microsoft has handled Java was that Microsoft did not have the right to
distribute their implementation via the web, though
they did have licensing rights to include it with Windows.
So essentially, Microsoft has things backwards, as it seems.
Well, to avoid further web distribution arguments, Microsoft
has yanked the JVM from the Windows Update site and all
other areas of Microsoft's web site. Microsoft is still
planning to include Java with Windows XP Service Pack 1.
You'll have to plan for Java support accordingly, as SP1 is
still a ways off and you can't get it from Microsoft at this
point. If you need it for a new installation of Windows XP
in the short term, Sun will gladly provide you with their
own distibution.

Another Xeon Deal
Served up by Warren Dugas

http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?sku=C170-1032%20P

I mentioned a really nice deal on Compaq Evo W6000 dual-
Xeon workstations a few weeks back, which I know several of
you took advantage of, but the $1999 price tag likely scared
off many others. If you still want to get into a Xeon, check
this one out. TigerDirect is offering an Evo W8000
workstation with a single 1.7GHz processor, 18.2GB 15,000rpm U160
drive, 48x CD-ROM and licenses for both Windows 2000 Pro and
NT 4.0 Workstation for $699.99. Note that there is NO memory
and no video card included, so you'll have to scrounge those for
yourself, but it really is a pretty good deal, on the whole.
Also realize that these systems take RAMBUS memory, which
will add a bit of cost, so be sure you know what you're
getting - a wicked-fast workstation, to be sure! Expandability is also quite amazing with these machines.

Recommend It!
