Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has
been in there since before 1998. (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to
sequences.tcl and back again). I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a
one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages
removed. (I think.)

That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and
Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it
only reads the sequences if the file has been touched. Look for the
"Exmh_Debug Reading $filename" output in the debug log to see when sequences
are actually reread from disk.

My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often. I'm about to
investigate that.

Thanks.
