It's not hard math - jpeg is a straight block-based DCT with
quantisation - which is about the oldest image compression
algorithm out there, and I think certainly predates 1986. So I
really have no idea what they claim they've patented - doin DCT
on 8x8 blocks of an image, quantising the resulting coefficients,
or DCT in general? I'm extremely skeptical about this whole
story...

MPEG 1, 2, 4 or 7? They're all very different compression
algorithms.

Anyway, here's to ogg, and hopefully the future mpeg4-standard
compression algorithm the project comes up with (fingers
crossed). And I wouldn't worry about the jpeg thing - in addition
the patent runs out next year, and I would suggest that having
failed to protect their IP for 15 years, as (iirc) is their
responsibility, their claim would probably never hold up in
court.

Cheers,
Dave.
