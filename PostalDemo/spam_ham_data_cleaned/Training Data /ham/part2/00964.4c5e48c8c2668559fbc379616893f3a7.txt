Here's a fix that I think will make a real difference.

Ftoc_ShowSequences needs to be able to be called with an optional list of msgids
to update and if it's called that way it only removes or adds tags for those
messages. Then in places like MsgChange, we only update the messages which have
changed.

Also, a separate Ftoc_ShowSequence function which only updates the display of
one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids.
In a place like MsgChange, it would only need to update the cur sequence.

If nobody else gets to it, I'll do this when I get back.
