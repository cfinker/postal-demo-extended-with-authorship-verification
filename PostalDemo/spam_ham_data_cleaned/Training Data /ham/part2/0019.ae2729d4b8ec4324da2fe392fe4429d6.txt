Greetings from Download.com!
If you're developing Windows applications in an
ActiveX-compatible environment (which includes most major ones
such as Visual Basic and C++), it's time you started taking
advantage of prefab programming components. An amazing array of
controls are out there, with more arriving at Download.com
every day. This week, we've collected the top programs that
handle transparent GIF files, offer prebuilt ActiveX controls,
and edit hex code to get you up and running.

Also this week, we've got two really useful ActiveX entries:
FileSystem 1.2 and AppSecureX 2.9. FileSystem gives you access
to drives, folders, and I/O operations; and AppSecureX adds
serial number and shareware-type functionality to your
applications.

MySQL/PHP functions to streamline development
Code reuse is one of the keys to increasing developer
productivity. This article looks at several handy functions
you can use to save time when building applications using
PHP and MySQL.

FileSystem 1.2
Having problems wrangling the Windows File System? The
FileSystem ActiveX control offers complete access to common
file information under Windows through three independent
interfaces. Everything from drive and folder access to file
I/O operations is available with only a few lines of code.
Use this control's interfaces to detect media types and
media insertion, get complete lists of folders and files at
unlimited folder depth, find out what attributes are set on
files, and even load logbook files into collections
automatically. Rope in your files.

ApSecureX 2.9
Prevent pirates from copying your software with AppSecureX.
This control provides a registration system that produces a
valid serial number customized to the user's machine. When
the user installs your software, a unique ID number is
generated for that system. To get the serial number, the
user must provide you with his installation number. The
data file created by the application is encrypted
differently for each system, so even if someone were to
crack the file, they couldn't use the information on
another machine. AppSecure can also give your software
shareware functionality such as number of days left, checking
to see if the system clock is set back, and so on. AppSecureX
works with any ActiveX-enabled programming language such as
Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++. A demo
application is included. Lock up your software.

in Java
AppletFile 2.5
AppletFile is a set of Java applets that will enhance your
Web site's file upload and download capabilities. In
addition to support for SSL, proxy, and authenticated
uploading, users can upload and download multiple files
using predefined paths to automate the process as much as
possible. A scripting language provides for sophisticated
customization, and the user interface includes support for
12 different languages. Transfers are faster because the
applet uses its own compression (AutoZIP). The AutoSYNC
feature downloads only updated files, and verification of
file transfer integrity is made possible with built-in
support for MD5 message digests. AppletFile is based on
HTTP protocols and is firewall-friendly. This update adds
Sun's Java Plug-in support for Netscape 6+ browsers and
shows removable media drives in the browse dialog. Beam up
your files.

in Tools & Editors

PHP Master Editor 2.0
Write, edit, and debug PHP scripts and HTML pages with this
tool. PHP Master Editor includes an internal browser for
viewing, as well as a debugger for local testing. Basic FTP
capability is also included. Specifically designed for PHP
programmers, the program recognizes and formats functions,
variables, and classes within the code, and features
customizable code templates. Get code-happy.
