glibc is a likely candidate.

Keep an eye on eBay. One annoyance of eBay is that many sellers state "will
ship to US only". However, I've found that if you ask nicely, they will
usually ship over here. For payments, either setup a paypal account or
post the seller a US dollar bank draft. I've got lots of little bits and
pieces that way (for example, finally got my hands on a rackmount kit for
my DECserver 700 terminal server which I'd been looking for for ages, for
a total of US$15).

Later,
Kenn
