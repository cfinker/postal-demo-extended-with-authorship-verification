If that's what you would like to believe, go right ahead.

No, not at all. I was only concerned where the border between religion
and cult gets real fuzzy, and where the r/c in question has known
paranoiac tendencies.

Then again, maybe you're right, it's a very close match in job
descriptions. Obviously it does not concern anyone else, and since
it's none of my business, I'll shut up about it and put it down to
more funky fun in US politics.

Afterall, all I know for certain about the Mormons is the background
and fallout on my ex-wife's excommunication ;)
