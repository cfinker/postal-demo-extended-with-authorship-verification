As far as I can remember, the fact that the IPID is zero was introduced into
2.4 was to introduce correct behaviour, i.e. in the case where it is not
needed, it is set to zero. This was discussed on bugtraq a while
ago....lemme see...
http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/archive/bugtraq/2002/03/msg00372.html shows a
message from nmap's author on the subject. The only thing having IPID==0
achieves is that you have one more criteria on which to base your OS
fingerprint which isn't really much of a problem to be honest.

Stop worrying about it :)
