I've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project.
Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers volunteering a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations.

Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to
spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a
good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for organizations that might be in need of such skills. And, I've
seen some very interesting suggestions for names for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the
above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the
subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort
through my email system.

It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users.
According to this article on The Register, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its
previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2
upgrade at $129.

I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how
difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues,
by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early
2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which

were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few

years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain

free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income sources.

On a brighter note, it looks like Mandrake has found a sweet spot. According to their most
recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the
company's
history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put
them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will
only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was
the result of the Mandrake Linux User's
Club.

The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
partnership venture, an agreement with Microtel to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on WalMart.com.
I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine
charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the
addition of both Lindows
and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail
computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.

Have a great Wednesday.

Checking Mail With KMail

I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me from

my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail,
procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong
contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE
desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.

There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't
automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much
time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the
additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an
irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple
configuration issue.

To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in

your KDE panel. Select "Preferences" and the "Execute" tab. In the Execute
window, change the command line to read:

kmail --check -caption "%c" %i %m

The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when
you open the program.

Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?

Kernel Configuration - Part XIII

As you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for
networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to
stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should

come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel
configuration is dense with details and options.

I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of
the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock
configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas.
You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be
used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external).

Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.

For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:

The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo
covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel
configuration issues

Linux Network Security from Linux Planet
a nice tutorial on network security
Network Security with /proc/sys/net/ipv4
other approaches to network security

These should get you started. Tomorrow, we'll cover telephony support in your
Linux kernel.

PyMP3Cut

http://www.librelogiciel.com/software/PyMP3Cut/

"PyMP3Cut is a Python commandline tool designed to cut huge (> 100MB) MP3 files
at high speed without requiring the extra disk space and processing time usually

needed by visual audio editing tools, which convert the MP3 format to more
easily manageable formats like WAV before doing anything. It reads and cuts
simultaneously according to the autodetected MP3 frame rate and a timeline
passed as a commandline argument."

More Windows for Linux
Scribbled by Ken Knull

"I'm reading your Codeweavers/CrossOver project stuff, and have comments
on another option I use.

"I have been using Win4Lin ( http://www.netraverse.com/ ) for several
months now, on an i686 boxen which runs RH 7.2, and now also
most windoze (nonXP / NTFS apps).

"I love it, and highly recommend it, and if you'd like more details /

Linux PR

http://linuxpr.com/

If the daily Linux news sites are starting to get you down, maybe it's time for
a change. Linux PR is an up-to-the-minute listing of events and developments in
the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most recent articles in
descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real
downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very
company-oriented - clearly the work of PR firms cranking out press releases.
Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and keeping up on
your favorite OS.
