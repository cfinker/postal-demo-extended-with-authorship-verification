Yeah, I get that. I just think this is a poor
example. Corporate bankruptcy is a power fight
between creditors, management, and shareholders
over control of assets. Because a corporation is
incorporeal (hee, hee), it can't be much else.

If you're concerned about the imbalance of power
related to corporations, I think the more relevant
areas are tax structures, especially the income
tax, various forms of externality, law related to
employment, corporate transparency, and corporate
governance.
