"A case in point is web designer Matt Jones, the man
responsible for how BBC News Online looked when it launched.
Since then, he has invented 'warchalking', which he recently
described as a 'curse'..."

stiffening sinews

More hot summer days in the mailinglist alleyways,
dangerously empty of sane postings, strewn with the rotting
carcasses of broiling vacation messages. Hacktress and
Silicon Valley's chief rat-keeper LILE ELAM, excitedly posts
about a new open 802.11 network she's found. "I am here at
the police station waiting to see a judge and I thought I
would check to see if there is connectivity", she writes,
somewhat recklessly, to the Bay Area Wireless list. Exit
the rest of the Wifi community through the nearest window
and out into the streets... where, cooling tempers, the
Microsoft Palladium boys are on an endless summer tour,
reassuring the experts that while, hmm, they *suppose* Pd
could *theoretically* be used as a Hollywood DRM system,
they truly have no plans to do any such thing. Cypherpunk
and friend of freedom Lucky Green hears this; thinks up four
or five of the obvious Palladium DRM implementations; sends
them off to be patented in his name. Licensing funds, we
imagine, will go on cracking his own DRMs. And so the mail
loops on.

Could Lucky get himself arrested under the DMCA for
distributing a circumvention device? Worse: now we have the
EUCD incoming, could he here in the UK? Will Alan Cox go to
jail for posting detailed Changelogs? Will even the nicest
UK cryptographer (or curious garage tinkerer) find
themselves hauled up under our new and scarily DMCAish
copyright regime? Find out the facts at the free FAIR DEAL
FOR COPYRIGHT conference, organised by the irrepressible
FOUNDATION FOR INFORMATION POLICY RESEARCH for Wednesday
2002-09-18 at the London School of Economics. All the usual
fun from the creators of the Scrambling for Safety crypto
cons: we confidently predict government spokesmen caught in
headlights, wanton Dave Bird heckling, some industry bigwig
fighting off the audience with a broken chairleg, and other
epiphenomena of the interzone between legal minds and hacker
ethics. Oh, and FIPR are still looking for a Programme
Director, so if you're interested, let them know. We
suggested a convention raffle (first prize: the director's
job, second prize: Ross Anderson as your personal slave for
a day). They say there's some rule that would break, though.

- doesn't the Foundation use psychohistory for filling these positions?

For those of us who can't read the abbreviation EULA without
thinking of Martian fighting machines and their "deafening
howls... which roared like thunder", we're sorry to report
that this weekend's multimedia performance of Jeff Wayne's WAR
OF THE WORLDS has been postponed due to "health and safety
issues". The event was to feature computer graphics,
fireworks, "60ft-tall Martian fighting machines" wreaking
"havoc and destruction", and - most terrifyingly of all - the
possibility of a David Essex tribute singer performing with
Hawkwind, but UKP18 tickets for the Sat 2002-08-31 show at
Manchester's Heaton Park will still be valid at a range of new
venues next summer. Ironically, the Martians' original
invasion plans were similarly thwarted by health and safety
issues, "slain after all man's devices had failed by the
humblest creatures that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this
earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. For, directly
the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies
attacked them..."
