Having not had a baby meself, but having listened to my mother and
countless others retell the tale, I'd reccomend to Adam a few bits of
advice:
1) We don't generally have sex just to get preggers. You'd never get
laid if that was the case. BUt hey, if we can convince you that the reason
women don't have sex with you adam is because they don't want to carry
your embittered, angry child, well hey. Girls Win!
2) Birth control. Let me say this again because Adam has forgotten the
last 50 years (at least for the pill) BIRTH control.
3) For many women with men who can actually uh... satisfy, sex is great.
Maybe you're lacking in this department ? ;)

So moral of the story: Women, keep telling Adam that no one will have
sex with him because they don't want to get preggers with his angry,
bitter children and go through the pain of childbirth.
yea.. thats it.

;)
