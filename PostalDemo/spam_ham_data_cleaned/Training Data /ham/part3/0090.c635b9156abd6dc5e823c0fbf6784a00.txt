Greetings from Download.com!
No software developer is immune to bugs. Even the cleanest code
will have to go through a debugging process, but some debuggers
are more efficient than others. Check out Download.com's
complete collection of debugging tools here, and put away the
can of Raid.

Also this week, we've got some very handy utilities. First,
there's Chilkat, a cool zip/unzip ActiveX control that you can
add to any language with ActiveX support (which is most major
ones). But my personal favorite is VB-PowerWrap, a simple tool
that takes all the far-flung bits and pieces of your Visual Basic
masterpiece and socks them all away into one executable file
for ease of distribution.

Achieving
persistence with Entity Beans
Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) allow for greater code reuse and
flexibility. See how Entity Beans enable you to leverage EJB
functionality in your apps.

Counting
lines of code can help measure progress
One developer has come around to thinking that counting lines
of code can yield useful information. He explains why and
shares a sample app that automates the process.

Chilkat Zip 6.0.2
Need to add zip capability to your apps? Create and
decompress zip archives with the Chilkat Zip ActiveX
control. The control provides easy access to individual files
stored within a zip archive. You can search for a file within
the zip using a wildcard string and then extract individual
files or files matching a pattern. Files can be unzipped to
any directory, and the control's memory management allows any
size file to be compressed or decompressed in a constant
memory footprint. The control allows you to compress directly
from memory buffers or strings, as well as add multiple files
with wildcarding. There's even a real-time progress monitor
for zip and unzip operations. Chilkat supports Active Server
Pages, Visual Basic, Visual C++, Delphi, C++ Builder, and all
languages that use ActiveX controls.

in Java
Anfy Java 2.0
Anfy is a collection of 52 applets for Web pages, desktop
wallpapers, or screensavers. Within the program's simple
interface, you can quickly apply real-time graphic effects to
GIF and JPEG images. Effects include 3D texture-mapped cube
menus, lake effects, water and fire, deformations, zoom
rotators, lens magnification, waving flags, animations,
scrolling text, customizable IFS fractals, color changers,
light shading, tunnels, and wormholes.

in Tools & Editors

VB-PowerWrap 3.1
Distribute Visual Basic applications the easy way with
VB-PowerWrap. VB-PowerWrap embeds all dependent and
non-dependent files into the executable of your VB program,
including DLLs and OCXs, graphics, databases, and text files,
to create a single clickable application. VB-PowerWrap scans
a VB project, wraps the appropriate files, and creates a
self-contained file for distribution. In addition,
VB-PowerWrap compresses all DLLs and OCXs and registers
appropriate controls on the user's machine if needed. It
works with Visual Basic 4, 5, and 6.
