but that's just stupid. microsoft s/w covers a subset of applications
that are under the gpl. there are gpl word processors, there's a
microsoft wp; there are various language compilers and interpreters under
the gpl, microsoft has their visual compilers. and so on. and just
like the gpl apps, the microsoft apps are distributed under a license.
that license says lots of things, and there are various licenses used by
microsoft, but in a nutshell they all pretty much say: you can't copy,
distribute or modify their s/w; you can't sell it multiple times.

so does anyone think that applies to their wp documents or their visual
c++ code?
