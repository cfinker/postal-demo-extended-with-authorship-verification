If you'll look closely, I said the Forest Service official claimed it was
the tree lovers lawsuits that prevented removal of trees by any means as at
least partially responsible. The lawsuits prevented the Forest Service
from implementation of any project that involved tree removal. These
projects were designed to address the tree and undergrowth density that
resulted from previous management policies.

In other words, Forest Service projects to clean up the mess resulting from
their previous forest management practices are prevented by tree lover
lawsuits.

Exactly, and tree lover lawsuits are preventing the removal of that
stuff. The result: Fires like Cerro Grande.

There are very few replacement forests planted these days. Those that are,
are mostly planted on private land as commercial tree farms.
