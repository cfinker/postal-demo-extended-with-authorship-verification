> Yes, and the working class deserves what it gets, ...

Careful now, you're talking about
most (80%) of the country.

(although perhaps it is true that in
a democracy, the people wind up with
the government which they deserve)

> ... I grew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US ...

... and there is a large excluded middle
between those "in poverty" and those who
are more affluent than "working class".

I don't know what poverty officially is,
but from a CA perspective, $15k income is
not going to go far. At current interest
rates, one would probably want somewhere
around $500k* wealth to throw that amount,
which pretty much limits the non-working
class to a small, single-digit percentage
of households. (how much overlap do we
have with the retirement cohort here?)

The 2000 numbers pretty much confirm it:

shows that the top 5% of incomes are mostly
two+-earner households, and the zero-earner
households are rare above median incomes.
We are the workers' paradise.

The census figured $18k as the cutoff for
lowest 5th, so with that as a poverty line,
the percentages break down as follows:

work\pov. yes no
yes 9 72
no 11 8

"[Irvine] "Everyone has to take a job sometime" / NH3"

(1998 wealth data was supposedly released
in 2001, but I haven't seen it yet on the
census site. Anyone have a pointer?)

>>From what little I have heard, the
legislation simply says that lying
in one's public figures is not just
a matter of cheating the accounts,
but really involves stealing time
and money from one's employees and
investors. How does not tolerating
the bad apples equate to punishing
the good ones?
