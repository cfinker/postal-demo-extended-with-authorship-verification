| From: "Matthew French"
|[ ... ]
| Now here is a thought: a Unix version of the "Deleted Items" folder.
|
| In the root of a hard drive, create a directory ".unwanted".
| Then periodically create hard links to every file on the hard
| drive that does not have hard links.
|
| That way, when someone accidentally does "rm *" or whatever,
| you still have a link under ".unwanted" [ ... ]

hum. interesting variation on the classic technique of
redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations
are endless). these classic techniques only provide a
means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
hard link idea.

but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
back of accidental overwrites.

( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the "snapshot"
facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers. and of the
various "versioning" filesystems which appeared --- and
then vanished? --- over the years.... )

one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
hard links. both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*
files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets
complain if there are hard links.

cheers,
