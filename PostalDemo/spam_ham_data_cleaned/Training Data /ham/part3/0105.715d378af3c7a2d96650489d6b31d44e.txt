Dear Readers,
I'm sure you've seen those annoying X-10 cameras ads popping up left and right while surfing the Internet. One day, out of curiosity, I decided to check this bothersome company's Web site. To my amazement, I found that their miniature cameras are pretty darn tiny, and you can mount them practically anywhere. But what does the law says about using them? I wouldn't want anyone to invade my privacy with that sort of camera setup. Coincidentally, I ran across this interesting discussion about this in the Boards, where members were discussing these miniature cameras, called CCTVs, and the privacy concerns around them. So if you want more info or would like to leave your two cents' worth about this, send us a post. Besides, this information might keep you from getting caught on camera in an embarrassing situation.
