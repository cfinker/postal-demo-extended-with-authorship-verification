It looks like you're running via procmail -- what are the permissions
on procmail? "Insecure dependency" screams "I'm in taint mode!", which
is a typical problem when procmail is setuid/setgid (the permissions
should be 755).

If this is in fact the problem, an easy solution is to put "DROPPRIVS=3Dyes"
in the procmailrc. :)
