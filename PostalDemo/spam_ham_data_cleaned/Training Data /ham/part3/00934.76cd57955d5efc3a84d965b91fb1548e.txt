What confuses me is, because these "scam" artists are laying out all
the contact information right out on the table, why don't the police
simply pose as recipients of the scam email and trap them? I mean,
I get no less than a half dozen a day and they should be real easy
to corner.

The only answer must be that the authorities in the countries in
question must be in on the scam, but isn't international fraud (and
kidnapping and murder if the reports I've seen on the media are true)
isn't this an Interpol thing?

I mean, the perpetrators are not exactly hiding, are they?

What I really don't understand is why I keep getting more of these.
Don't they know by now that I already made my millions on the first one?
