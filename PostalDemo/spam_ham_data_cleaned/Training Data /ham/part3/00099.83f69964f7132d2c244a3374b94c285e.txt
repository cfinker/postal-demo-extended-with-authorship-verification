Jobs touts OS X, iPods, iMac

NEW YORK--Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs on Wednesday defended the company's switch to the Mac OS X operating system and unveiled new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.
Jobs used his keynote speech at the Macworld trade show here to make a flurry of other announcements as well, such as details about new syncing software, the next update to OS X and the end of free iTools.

The most dramatic announcement focused on iPod. The new players include ones built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system.

Scient files for Chapter 11

Internet consulting firm Scient has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and agreed to sell certain assets to a professional services firm.
The deal calls for Salt Lake City-based SBI to hire some of Scient's employees and to provide up to $4.9 million in financing, pending completion of the asset acquisition.

Scient has been struggling for some time now. Once a dot-com darling, the company recently approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split.

The company and SBI said they expect the bankruptcy court to approve the deal, adding that financing "will allow Scient to continue to deliver services to its clients without interruption until court approval of SBI's acquisition is received."

Yahoo Mail puts words in your mouth

What does Yahoo Mail have against mocha?
That's what users of the company's free e-mail service may be wondering if they try to send a message using the word "mocha" and discover that while in transit, "mocha" mysteriously changes to "espresso."

To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as "mocha" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.

The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as "Web enhanced" can contain JavaScript instructions that can run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.

Microsoft sweetens Mac Office offer

With sales of its Office suite for Mac OS X falling short of projections, Microsoft plans on Wednesday to announce a rebate for those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac.
The promotion, which runs through Sept. 30, entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software. Microsoft is also offering two new pieces of downloadable software: one that lets Palm handhelds synchronize directly with Office v. X and another that lets the Macintosh view programs running on a Windows PC or server.

New chip may portend ATI comeback

ATI, once the leader in graphics chips, will launch its comeback bid this week with a new chip that experts say could put the company back in front in terms of performance.
The Markham, Ontario-based company on Thursday will unveil the details of the Radeon 9700, a desktop graphics chip based on a new architecture that will provide greater realism when it comes to 3D images, according to sources.

The fastest versions of the new chips will offer considerably higher performance than Nvidia's current GeForce4 roster, giving ATI the edge with gamers as well as PC makers, analysts said. And even after Nvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999--comes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two will remain close.
