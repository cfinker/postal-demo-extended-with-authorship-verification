Speaking of HP Designjets, has anyone managed to utilise the full width of
the paper on a HP Designjet 750c under RH7.x? The HP can take a 24" wide
roll while the driver (dnj650c) lists a paper size of 16x24.
Unfortunately, this will print only in protrait mode so I get a 24"x24"
page with an unused 8" strip down one side! I'd like to be able to print
24x or whatever (even 24x30!) but I don't seem able to do so.

Any thoughts?
