| I'm hoping that all people with no additional sequences will notice are
| purely cosmetic changes.

Well, first, when exmh (the latest one with your changes) starts, I get...

can't read "flist(totalcount,unseen)": no such element in array
while executing
"if {$flist(totalcount,$mhProfile(unseen-sequence)) > 0} {
FlagInner spool iconspool labelup
} else {

}"

(procedure "Folder_Change" line 3)
invoked from within
"Folder_Change $exmh(folder)"
(procedure "Exmh" line 101)
invoked from within
"Exmh"
("after" script)

which is probably related to my not having an "unseen" sequence anywhere
(certainly not in inbox) - I read all of my outstanding mail before I
tried this new exmh ...

Second, I've been used to having a key binding which was to Msg_MarkUnseen
which doesn't seem to exist any more, and I'm not sure what I should replace
that with. There's obviously a way as the "Sequences" menu does this.
The "Mark Unseen" menu entry in the message "More" menu is still wanting
that function as well...

| For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to
| display the other sequences.

Any chance of having that lengthen instead? I like all my exmh stuff
in nice columns (fits the display better). That is, I use the detached
folder list, one column. The main exmh window takes up full screen,
top to bottom, but less than half the width, etc...

I have space for more sequences, in the "unseen" window, as long as they
remain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be
ordered by some preference, then ones which didn't fit would just fall
off the bottom, and not be shown).

I'd also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring,
just one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with
background black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or
other decorations, but made "sticky" - the appearance is just like the
folders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the
root window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around
and do I can see when new mail needs processing).

I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur
in one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created). So in addition to
the "sequences to always show" and "sequences to never show", a
preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder
would be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the
folder I'm visiting appear in the list when that folder is current.
This is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining
productive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message
in a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message,
it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is
packed, sorted, etc).

I haven't updated my exmh for some time now, so I'm not sure if this
next one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the
bar with New Flist Search ...) only contains "unseen" and "urgent".
It would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder
happens to have defined. A "New sequence" entry would also be useful
(to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist,
which can be done now using "Search" and the pick interface, but is
clumsy that way)

Actually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name
in the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the
list of messages, and no pick attributes at all, I now get ...

syntax error in expression "int(1+1+(1 hit-1)*(3868-1-2)/(4878-1))"
while executing
"expr int($minlineno+1+($msgid-$minmsgid)*($maxlineno-$minlineno-2)/($maxmsgid-$minmsgid))"

It has been ages since I did this last though. I tried adding a Subject
to pick on (easy as I know what's in the message...) which made no difference.
Looks as if something is now saying "1 hit" when before it didn't, or
similar.

| I've also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a
| week or so ago.

Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
Just to make it stand out a fraction more than it does (maybe this is
more apparent to me than many, as I use very small fonts everywhere,
the background of the ftoc line isn't very wide).

Hope this helps.

Message-ID:

| I can't reproduce this error.

For me it is very repeatable... (like every time, without fail).

This is the debug log of the pick happening ...

18:19:03 Pick_It {exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace} {4852-4852 -sequence mercury}
18:19:03 exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace 4852-4852 -sequence mercury
18:19:04 Ftoc_PickMsgs {{1 hit}}
18:19:04 Marking 1 hits
18:19:04 tkerror: syntax error in expression "int ...

Note, if I run the pick command by hand ...

delta$ pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace 4852-4852 -sequence mercury
1 hit

That's where the "1 hit" comes from (obviously). The version of nmh I'm
using is ...

delta$ pick -version
pick -- nmh-1.0.4 [compiled on fuchsia.cs.mu.OZ.AU at Sun Mar 17 14:55:56 ICT 2002]

And the relevant part of my .mh_profile ...

delta$ mhparam pick
-seq sel -list

Since the pick command works, the sequence (actually, both of them, the
one that's explicit on the command line, from the search popup, and the
one that comes from .mh_profile) do get created.

kre

ps: this is still using the version of the code form a day ago, I haven't
been able to reach the cvs repository today (local routing issue I think).

ASK THE FOOL

Q. I'M TIRED OF GETTING SO MANY CREDIT CARD OFFERS IN THE MAIL.
I ALREADY HAVE
A CARD AND I DON'T WANT ANY MORE MAIL OFFERING ME NEW ONES. HOW
CAN I STOP IT?

A. There are three main credit bureaus in the United States, and
they've agreed that if someone contacts one of them and asks to
be removed from junk mail (er, "direct mail") lists and
telemarketing phone lists, they'll all honor the request.

Full Answer:

YOUR MONEY

RESOLUTIONS YOU CAN KEEP
Let's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that
hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore
everywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions
because they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1.
Live every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight.
No pressure. Right? Wrong.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=562070

Don't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list
that is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks
now and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution
you can get behind. Let's get started!

1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT
It's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with
one phone call.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562071

2. GET MORE FROM YOUR SAVINGS
Don't stash your short-term cash savings under your mattress.
Earn higher yields on CDs, money markets, and more.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562072

3. INVEST FOR LESS
Make sure your broker isn't charging you too much. Compare rates
and hire a new one in only 60 seconds.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562073

4. RETIRE EARLY
Thanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more
to your retirement accounts.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562074

5. REFINANCE AND SAVE
When interest rates drop, some homeowners have the opportunity
to save big money.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562075

If this list seems too daunting, and you don't want to go it
alone, you can get some unbiased, professional advice about your
finances with TMF Money Advisor. In fact, we're so excited about

-----------------------------------------------------------------
SPOTLIGHT

SHOULD ALL MY SAVINGS BE IN THE MARKET?
Um, no.

We are big supporters of the idea that all of your long-term
money should be in the stock market. But over the short term,
the market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is
really speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have
your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's
tuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you
can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your
savings, keep it out of the market.

Of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. To figure
out the best place to keep your short-term savings, visit our
nifty Savings Center.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
COMMUNITY TIPS

DO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY
Folks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been
sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in
2002 to save money.

-I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse
so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of
stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my
coupons at home.

-Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I
have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff,
like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is
$3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30
bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for.

-I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't
get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be
a great time to do this.

-Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find
a cheaper long-distance plan.

-Document everything that I give to charity, including the
clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes.

-Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the
house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat).

Have any tips of your own? Add to the growing list here.

Was it intended that if you added a sequence to the 'never show' list that

then hit 'save' for Preferences - didn't take effect till I restarted.

No it wasn't, and at one point it worked fine. I'll check and see why it

So is this mountain limestone or granite?

Michael's Minute:
Lindows.com Report Card

As summer arrives, many school children are coming home with their
report cards. I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of
grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation..

To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click
here .

Operating System:

As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways.
One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com
, for as little as $299. This is a
significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder
(Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the
box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks.

For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we
offer the Insider program . This gives
people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS
as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about
80% of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow,
consequently, this product is not yet for everyone.

Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart
when the program available directly
from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is
the Walmart computers are certified,
ensuring that all components work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much
different than offering a software program that will work on any
computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference
between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus
opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The
first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job.

While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS
installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support
a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade: B
_____

Software:

Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on
their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to
add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school,
home or business.

Click-N-Run is the easiest way to
load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system
has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With
1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse
, users can find quality software
titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click
download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included
in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point.
Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future.
Grade: A-
_____

Microsoft Windows Compatibility:

We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the
legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to
support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help
people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers
come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft
applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel
documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people
to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit
Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our
Warehouse such as OpenOffice
.

Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since
they're included in the Warehouse .
Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're
investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based
programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer
support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to
MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get
better in the above areas. Grade: B
_____

Communication:

We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going
which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute
. While our overall goal has not deviated -
Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more
focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have
told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing
running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you
detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs,
forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating
system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid.

Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change
the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library
of 1,000+ software titles all for a
flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to
think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable.

There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around
- which happens when you have a small organization which can't address
every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these
in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about
Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths Grade:

Bringing Choice to Your Computer!

LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being
offered from Lindows.com Builder
partners. The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download
and preview to Lindows.com Insider
partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to
install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware. The
General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware
and includes unique features such as a "Friendly-Install" alongside an
existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation
process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a
select set of "bridge" Windows-compatible programs. For more information

Ah....I think this may be a user error. If you change the field in the

Since the pick command works, the sequence (actually, both of them, the

Cable companies cracking down on Wi-Fi

Broadband providers are cracking down on popular Wi-Fi networks, threatening to cut service to customers who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.
Time Warner Cable of New York City has given 10 customers less than a week to stop using their accounts to provide a wireless local area network available to anyone within 300 feet. The letters are just an initial volley; Time Warner expects to send additional letters, while AT&T Broadband also is preparing similar letters for some of its customers.

Apple's iPod comes to Linux

Windows users have recently been given access to the popular Macintosh music player, iPod, and now Linux users may soon be able to take a bite out of Apple Computer's gadget. Last week, tex9, a small software-development company in San Francisco, began beta testing an iPod plug-in for its xtunes music player software, which is itself a Linux clone of Apple's iTunes. The plug-in will, tex9 promises, allow drag-and-drop access to iPod, which holds up to 10GB of music.

I have been trying to research via SA mirrors and search engines if a canned
script exists giving clients access to their user_prefs options via a
web-based CGI interface. Numerous ISPs provide this feature to clients, but
so far I can find nothing. Our configuration uses Amavis-Postfix and ClamAV
for virus filtering and Procmail with SpamAssassin for spam filtering. I
would prefer not to have to write a script myself, but will appreciate any
suggestions.

I kind of doubt that any pre built-in sequence name is going to be
very general. Even "unseen" can be changed (fortunately that one
is easy to find in the MH profile - though whether exmh does that,
os just uses "unseen" I haven't bothered to find out).

exmh uses the profile setting - it appears as mhProfile(unseen-sequence)
in the code.

Michael's Minute: Do the Math...Dispel the Myths

A reporter came by the Lindows.com offices
last Friday. He told me that he wanted to try and use
LindowsOS to
write a story, but he didn't think it was possible because his office
used Microsoft Word .doc files. I asked him to have a seat and watch.

I turned on the Walmart.com computer
and then clicked on the running man
which took me to the Click-N-Run Warehouse
where I installed OpenOffice
using Click-N-Run. I then clicked
the "Run It" button which opened the word processor OpenOffice Writer.
I then typed "Linux is ready for the desktop and consumers can save
hundreds using LindowsOS." I selected "Save as Microsoft Word."

The reporter was not only surprised, he was amazed. Like many reporters,
he was under the impression that Linux was only for servers. The simple
word processor demonstration went a long way to show him otherwise. For
Linux to become a driving force in desktop computing it will have to
overcome a couple of myths.

The first myth is that Linux is too hard to install and configure. That
may have been true in the past, but we've annihilated this myth with the
latest version of LindowsOS --which installs on most machines in under 5
minutes. It's point- and-shoot easy - easier than any other operating
system (Microsoft products included). See for yourself at .

The other myth is that Linux is just for the server and none of the
graphical programs --which desktop users have come to rely on-- exist.
Not only have many of the Linux software programs made quantum leaps
over the last couple of years, but they've gotten quite good at reading
and writing Microsoft formats. The easiest way to experience these
products is via the Click-N-Run
Warehouse.

Here's a quick list of some of the quality programs available today in
the Warehouse all downloaded and
installed with a single click:

OpenOffice - This one installation will equip a computer with an
impressive collection of productivity programs each of which will open
the corresponding Microsoft file format and allow you to edit files and
swap them with Microsoft counterparts.
Programs included are:

OpenOffice Writer - Word processor (reads Microsoft Word docs)
OpenOffice Calc - Spreadsheet (reads Microsoft Excel)
OpenOffice Impress- Presentation package (reads Microsoft PowerPoint)
OpenOffice Draw - A vector based drawing program

Click here for a great
tutorial on getting to know OpenOffice.

GIMP If you are familiar with Adobe's Photoshop,
you'll want to Click-N-Run GIMP. It's a powerful image editor.

Evolution For those used to Microsoft's
Outlook email program Evolution will make them feel right at home. Check
out how easy it is to use .

Flowchart Pro, which is similar to Microsoft's Visio, is a rich
charting program that makes it possible to create flow charts and
organizational charts, plus more. See how easy it for yourself, visit
Flowchart Pro at

This is just a handful of the quality programs available in the
Warehouse that make Linux a practical choice
for the desktop today. And if you're still not convinced, then do the
math.

For a total cost of $499 , including
all software, computer users save more than $800 for a complete
system.

With such major price differentials between the two similarly equipped
systems, any business, school or home will find their computing dollars
stretched much further running LindowsOS.

LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being
offered from Lindows.com Builder
partners. The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download
and preview to Lindows.com Insider
partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to
install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware. The
General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware
and includes unique features such as a "Friendly-Install" alongside an
existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation
process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a
select set of "bridge" Windows-compatible programs. For more information

Cable companies cracking down on Wi-Fi

Broadband providers are cracking down on popular Wi-Fi networks, threatening to cut service to customers who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.
Time Warner Cable of New York City has given 10 customers less than a week to stop using their accounts to provide a wireless local area network available to anyone within 300 feet. The letters are just an initial volley; Time Warner expects to send additional letters, while AT&T Broadband also is preparing similar letters for some of its customers.

Apple's iPod comes to Linux

Windows users have recently been given access to the popular Macintosh music player, iPod, and now Linux users may soon be able to take a bite out of Apple Computer's gadget. Last week, tex9, a small software-development company in San Francisco, began beta testing an iPod plug-in for its xtunes music player software, which is itself a Linux clone of Apple's iTunes. The plug-in will, tex9 promises, allow drag-and-drop access to iPod, which holds up to 10GB of music.

The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Networks, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally created the Kazaa software.

I kind of doubt that any pre built-in sequence name is going to be
very general. Even "unseen" can be changed (fortunately that one
is easy to find in the MH profile - though whether exmh does that,
os just uses "unseen" I haven't bothered to find out).

Until this patch, exmh was full of hardcoded references to unseen. One of the
things I did was to change these to look in the already available global
variable with the value in it (which other parts of the code did use).

Anyway, I've just fixed the performance problem with repeatedly reading the
sequences files. I'll patch it in after I've run it for a while.

DECK
Version: 3.5
File size: 6.6MB
License: Free to try; $399.00 to buy
Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 9.x or Mac OS X

Looking for a professional, multitrack audio workstation
under OS X? This entry from BIAS, while maybe not the most
attractive Mac app on the block, gives you some hefty
editing functionality--whether you're working in broadcast,
film, video, or any other multimedia environment. The big
brother to BIAS' cheaper Deck LE, Deck 3.5 lets you process
soundtracks, edit dialogue, spot effects, and record
ADR-style voice-overs. Deck also supports surround mixing and
up to four real-time effects plug-ins per track for music
production. A good value, and one of the first of its kind
to hit OS X, this midrange app deserves a listen. You're on
Deck:

AQUILACALENDAR
Version: 1.19

License: Free to try; $20.00 to buy
Minimum Requirements: Mac OS X

One of the most frustrating things about off-the-shelf
organizer applications is that they try to force everyone to
keep track of things in the same way. AquilaCalendar is
refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar
windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,
week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize
your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists
and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a
handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The
interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting
organized no more difficult than it has to be. Get organized:

This is likely because to get it to boot, like the cobalt, I'm actually
passing root=/dev/hda5 to the kernel, not /dev/md0.

Just to solve this...the reason I was booting the box with
root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 was because /dev/md0 wasn't booting - it
would barf with 'can't find init'.

It turns out that this is because I was populating md0 with tar. Which
seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was
trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only
as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and
queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on
the new rootfs.

When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked
fine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked.

Woohoo.

Any chance of having that lengthen instead? I like all my exmh stuff
in nice columns (fits the display better). That is, I use the detache
d
folder list, one column. The main exmh window takes up full screen,
top to bottom, but less than half the width, etc...

I thought about that. The first order approximation would be to just add
using pack .... -side top instead of pack ... -side left, however, since their
each a different width, it would look funny.

I've done this. It's not as pretty as I think it should be, but it works.
I'm going to leave the cosmetic issues to others. When I update the
documentation, I'll add this to the exmh.TODO file.

I'm leaving for a 2 1/2 week vacation in a week, so this is the last new
functionality I'm going to add for a while. Also, I now have pretty much
everything in there that I want for my own use, so I'm probably pretty much
done. I'll work on bug fixes and documentation before my vacation, and
hopefully do nothing more afterwards.

SpamAssassin is hurting democracy!

Internet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro

NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and
ask for our votes.

Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.

In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.

That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.

Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones
through any of those channels.

The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.

His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money
in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication
mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.

No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society,
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different
unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.

The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.

When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them
to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60
percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail
accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.

Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better
ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient
groups.

But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter
an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without
opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage
the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam
advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail.
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

I don't usually spend much time explaining metaphors. They are, after all,
metaphorical. They can be filled with whatever symbolism you choose. Written
well, we all come to some similar understanding of their meaning. But, I'll
depart today, contrary to my normal practice, to take a few minutes explaining a

recent metaphor.

I'm a Linux guy through and through. As a user, I see myself as right about at
the average on the curve. For love of the language and open source attitude,
though, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone with quite the same level of
enthusiasm. Put simply, there's very little about the Linux and broader open
source worlds that I don't like or believe in.

Take, for example, the practice of recursive acronyms. GNU ("Gnu's Not Unix"),
HURD ("Herd of Unix-Replacing Daemons"), WINE ("Wine Is Not an Emulator"), even
PHP ("PHP Hypertext Processor") - all carry on the tradition of recursion in the

Unix/Linux world. Goofy as it sounds, I love this stuff.

So it is that I set out to create a recursive metaphor last week. It could only
have happened on or about the 4th of July. In fact, it happened in the edition
of the 3rd. I wrote a piece about how we Americans spend more time over the
course of a year talking about what's wrong with our system than what's
right. I wrote it knowing full well that many of the responses I'd get would be
a) from readers outside the US and b) in sharp disagreement to my comments or
those of citizens of other countries. You're following me, right? People would
disagree with an article that said we spend much time disagreeing. This, of
course, would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical way - the perfect
recursive metaphor. The point was to be made yet more perfectly by the eventual
inclusion in Penguin Shell of the comments of someone from outside the US

disagreeing with my take our argumentativeness as Americans. Ideally, they would

be comments that disagreed with our collective American perception of being
disagreeable. They would, of course, point out things about which citizens of
other countries can disagree with Americans on. By exercising the right to
disagree, we'd subtly agree that we have that right. Yet another level of
recursion and a final layer of metaphor.

The response to both my own and Johan Sauviller's comments was overwhelming. In
the main, I believe both were appreciated. Many commented on the balance of the
two pieces. Some readers were surprised, I think, to see a dissenting opinion
published so quickly, if at all. Overall, the ability to express honestly held
opinions, to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the circle on the
metaphor in a perfect way.

Things have, however, gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days. I'm not sure
whether some were slow in getting to the July 3rd issue, or whether it's just
been stewing since then. Take, for instance, these comments by a reader who will

remain mercifully nameless:

We get enough
America bashing from our left-wing whacko extremist press and schools here
in the USA that we don't wish to hear some (insert favorite adjective here)
from Belgium whining too!

Followed by:

... please don't let Tony single-handedly tarnish the fine reputation
of Lockergnome. I'm sure there are other articulate Linux experts out there who
would be able to replace him.

... and, in a later note on the topic ...

Censorship is to be encouraged in a
free-market society whenever and wherever it doesn't come from the
government.

Clearly, the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some.

Chris

has been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the editorial
piece at the beginning of each newsletter. This particular piece is no
exception. He's shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill
comments. While we all generally stay focused on technical issues, Chris has
shown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are, in the end, humans
with opinions and thoughts to share. I think it's one of the things that makes
the Lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack - the personal touch.

So, despite the irrationality of some of this week's comments, I'll continue to
occasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff.

Just watch out. Recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye
out.

Win Apps in Linux?

Yesterday, I mentioned an interesting review of two products for Linux by CodeWeavers - CrossOver
Office and CrossOver Plugin. You've probably heard of both by now, as they've
garnered quite a bit of publicity both in and out of the Linux world. You'll
recall that I promised to try to secure copies for review this week. With the
help of a friendly sales rep at CodeWeavers, I was able to accomplish that task
this morning. True to the second half of the promise, we'll spend the next few
days looking at these two products and how they might impact your Linux use.
Let's take them in chronological order, starting today with CrossOver Plugin.

A bit of background is in order. CodeWeavers is, in their own words, " ... the
leading corporate backer of the Wine Project. Wine has been, for the past several years, an
ongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux. It's a tough goal, but
it's also one that's been undertaken by others in the past year or so. Though the progress has been
slow, the Wine project has managed to stay at the front of this development
realm.

CrossOver
Plugin marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project. Prior to its
release, Wine had taken a "full system" approach. Running Windows applications
in Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no small amount of
configuration work. CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from the system-wide
approach to one that's much more modular. Rather than executing at system
startup, Wine is called as-needed, with the virtual Windows path to the called
program. When the program is closed, so is Wine. CrossOver Plugin has focused on

creating Linux functionality with one related set of Windows
applications: browser plugins.

The results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a
success. Off the top, CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime 5, Windows Media Player

6.2, Shockwave 8.5, Flash 6, and RealPlayer 8 into a Linux-accesible browser
plugin package. Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix, Trillian, Authorware Web
Player 6 and eFax Messenger 2, and you've got virtually every need plugin need
covered.

But this package doesn't stop there. Included in the CrossOver Plugin package
are viewers for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, as well as several
Microsoft-oriented fonts. Honestly, I was stunned at the range of applications
offered by the CodeWeavers developers.

Having had some experience with Wine, I was a bit leery about the install
process and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with
my RedHat setup. I've never been completely successful with Wine, but I hoped
for the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation. I really did want

these apps to work.

The installation was quite easy. By running the install-crossover.sh script from

the command line, I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver Plugin

and CrossOver Office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. I started the plugin
installs with QuickTime, a tool I've admittedly missed in Linux. In the
background, CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C:\ drive on my
machine. I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar sight

- the Vise installer in its Windows format. CrossOver Plugin first checked for
feedback from the Windows binary, opened a virtual Windows window, then stepped
out while the Vise installer took care of the rest. Though the install failed
four times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a failure of the
CrossOver program. I kept "retry"ing and, with some persistence, managed to get
a full QuickTime 5 install downloaded from the Apple servers. Quite literally,
the install looked and performed exactly as I've seem many times in Windows.
When the install was completed, CrossOver again checked for the Windows binary,
located the appropriate .dll files in the virtual C:\ drive and dropped the
plugins into the /home/tony/.netscape/plugins and /home/tony/.mozilla/plugins
directories.

The process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these
browsers - "Help", "About Plugins." Sure enough, the CrossOver QuickTime plugin
was listed. Quickly, I ran out to the Apple site and opened the "Men In Black
II" movie trailer. QuickTime performed flawlessly.

I followed with the Windows Media Player, Shockwave, Flash, IPix, and eFax
Messenger installs. Of those, the only ones that weren't self-contained in the
CrossOver install were IPix and eFax. Even at that, the installer pointed me to
the Windows download then found the .exe file when the download was done. Within

a half-hour, I had all installed and tested.

Then, just for grins, I installed RealPlayer 8 via CrossOver. This was despite
the recommendation in the installer screen to use the Linux version. It went as
smoothly as the others with one caveat - the player played media files at a much

faster speed than that in Windows. Fast enough to make me laugh, in fact,
reminded of Dave and Alvin the Chipmunk. Ah well, six out of seven is pretty
strong given my previous troubles with Wine.

I also installed a few fonts - Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, and Veranda.
In every case, the install was quick and absolutely painless.

Wine has always held great promise. At times, it's been painful to watch the
tedious pace of development, only because that promise was so alluring. With the

backing of CodeWeavers and a fundamental change in the approach to development,
Wine has finally realized the goal of integrating Windows applications
seamlessly into the stable Linux environment. The results are so strong that, if

I didn't know better, I'd swear that a few of these plugins actually run better
in Linux than in their native Windows. Honestly, I didn't realize how much I
missed them until I started using them in Linux today.

Tomorrow holds a few surpirses, with a look at CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office
package.

Kernel Configuration - Part IX

We're nine parts into the kernel configuration series, with quite a bit yet to
go. If you haven't been following along, we're breaking out the configuration
screens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and
function of each. With that knowledge, you should be able to make a clear
decision as to how to configure each section.

Today, it's the Parallel Port support section. This is pretty simple. If you
need parallel port support - such as for a printer - select this option either
as a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module.

Most will use the PC-style hardware option in conjuction with a Windows printer.

But that's not all the parallel port can be used for. As an example, the builds
I did with the telescope company required parallel port support, as the
telescope cameras were attached to this port.

Be aware - this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for
the parallel port. The computer's BIOS sets the mode for the port - ECP, EPP, or

Auto. On the majority of modern computers, the Auto mode is the default and will

work just fine. However, if you have problems communicating with your printer
following a kernel recompile, try changing the mode of your printer in the
BIOS.

Tomorrow, it's Plug and Play configuration.

Netics 2.0

http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/marius/netics/

"Netics is an extensible network statistics collector. It puts the network
interface in promiscuous mode and reads the data stream (after it strips off the

appropriate protocol headers), then displays the results at specified intervals,

either in a "progress bar" mode or as raw statistics. Currently, it supports 2
statistics, both involving entropy: LZW compressability and Ueli Maurer's
universal statistical test. Maurer's test is a very good and comprehensive
measure of entropy, but requires a large amount of data. The LZW statistic
requires much less data."

"Dear Linux community at Lockergnome.

"I am the web master for largest health care camp in the State of Utah.
No not Cancer camp it is the Diabetic camp.

"The Foundation for Children and Youth with Diabetes serves about 900
diabetic children a year and their families. We have education, family
support, diet planning and most important is camp. The place where kids
can learn about how to better manage their disease.

"We are a totally non profit camp that puts all money from fees into our
camp. We pay no salaries to Physicians, Dietitians, Social Workers,
Nurses and educators that make our camp possible. Yes even me the lowly
web master donates his time and web space at ATT to the cause.

"ATT recently decided to pull access to our photo page due to a password
protection. We give out a password to all parents so that they can see
photos of camp while the sessions are happening. We do not however what
the creeps of the web to have access to photos of our kids.

"We are looking for someone in the state to help our camp by donating web
space. Now it may not be your organization, but I know Linux people and
Lockergnome and I think someone there may know someone who would be able
to help us.

"You can still have access to the public part of our site that ATT has not
shut down at www.fcyd-inc.org.

Hi i have a phillips head skrew thats holding a circut board together i need
to take it out ASAP and nothing will work, the threads on the skrew are
almost completly gone, its is a very small skrew that i have to use a
percision skrewdriver set to remove the skrews any help would be
appreaciated...

Get a very, *very* small set of drill bits. Start drilling right
through the center of the head, at a slow speed so you don't pop
off and through the board! Once you have a bit of an indent in,
increase the speed a little bit.

If you've made a deepish indent, and the head doesn't pop off, use
the next largest drill bit you have. Repeat until happy.

Eventually the head should just pop off, allowing you to lift the
board off over the shaft of the screw... then ye can take out the
rest fairly easily with a pliers or whatnot.

Last week, Axialis Software
released IconWorkshop v5.0 - arguably the most powerful icon
editor / manager for the Windows platform. Ever the icon addict, I
asked for your pixel-perfect creations. I have yet to receive one.
Perhaps you've been waiting for the right motivation? How about a
nice little contest involving some of the most powerful sites on
the Internet? Here's the deal: you create five (or more) icons
between now and the end of July 2002, upload them to your [FREE]
DeviantArt account (under Contests / Axialis Icon Contest), and
one of the five judges may pick it. The panel includes: myself,
MattEO from DeviantArt,
KarmaGirl from WinCustomize, Voodoo from
Neowin, and Marc from
Axialis. We'll each pick our favorite set. The winners will not
only receive one copy of IconWorkshop Corporate Edition, but some
of their icons will get bundled with a future version of the
software! Ownership is retained by the original author, so don't
hold back. Here's your chance at fame and fortune. Or, at least
fame and free software.

Ah, the life of a software junkie! Pieter just released the new
(unofficial) Google SearchTool
today. It's much more convenient than the official toolbar (sorry,
I just don't like browser add-ons). I also gave
Cacheman
another go; I haven't used it since Windows 98. It's always been a
great piece of shareware, but I didn't realize it was THIS good.
The speed increase has been quite noticeable (even on Storm Shadow,
my P4 2.5GHz machine). Outer Technologies is brilliant. And so is
Repligator 9.0. It gives
me access to instant special effects - a one-stop shop for digital
photo fun. I'm still debating whether or not to install the latest
Java runtimes. It seems to be unobtrusive on my test machine,
which is good to see; I don't want browser integration, I just
wanna run that awesome ASCII Art program. Oh, and "12 Mistakes
Executives Make When Planning Web Strategy" is available for FREE
with the purchase of ANY GnomeTome (including our 50
freshly-released OS X tips). Go grab it if your boss doesn't know
as much as s/he should.

There's a little bit of Oingo Boingo on Emusic now. They inked a
deal with Universal Music Group today - and I'm not paying any
more to get access to even more MP3s. This is the ONLY
way to go, and I hope and pray that more record labels will
eventually catch on to the craze. The Internet is more than a
place for a pseudo-interactive pamphlet; the Internet fosters
knowledge; the Internet is still in its infancy; the Internet has
encouraged creativity and commerce. The one thing the Internet is
NOT: a fad. Its potential is limitless, as long as it remains
flexible and not controlled by any one company. This
Palladium
thing has got me more than a little spooked. It, combined with the
service-oriented OS, could very well be the thing that drives
people away from the Windows platform in droves (as much as I hate
to admit it). Software and music pirates unwittingly created DRM.
I best not find out that you're part of the problem.

See You in August, Chris Pirillo

SolarInfo v1.0 [1.1M] FREE

{Sun, moon, and planets} Why is it all the other planets have
really cool names for their respective moon(s), but Earth's is
simply referred to as "moon?" We should change it to something
catchier, like "Joey Joe-Joe Junior Shabbadu." Don't mind me, I
was just looking at this new application. It shows a graphical
representation of every planet in our solar system (as opposed to
every planet in the Hoth system) and its moons. It also provides
detailed information such as the planet's distance from the sun,
its volume, mass, and gravity in relation to Earth. What I found
most interesting was how long a single "day" lasts on different
planets. Did you know one day on Pluto is equal to six days on
Earth? I guess he chased Chip and Dale around the Christmas tree
for longer than we thought.

Pop-Up Menu Navigation Software
Scribbled by Pat Wong

http://popup.jscentral.com/

I found some really cool software to generate Web site navigation
menus, and I thought you might be interested in learning about it.
There are several examples on the company's site, as well as on my
own. Here's a small write-up about it; perhaps you'd be interested
in running this in a future Lockergnome issue? We've all seen a
lot of really cool site navigation menus, with pop-up text, neat
mouseover effects, and the like. Most of them require a
combination of HTML and JavaScript to build, which is expertise
that goes way beyond some of us. At last, it's possible to easily
generate just such a menu with some very user-friendly screens to
enter the data you want to use.

Pop-Up Menu comes in a freeware version, or you can get a fully
licensed version ($34.95 for a Home User license / $129.95 for the
Web Designer license). The biggest difference? With the licensed
version, you get the ability to save a menu you've generated so
you can modify it later. Your only alternative, if you want to
make even a simple change to a menu generated by the freeware
version, is to create the whole menu again from scratch (or diving
into the nuts and bolts of the code and modifying that). Be
forewarned: The JavaScript reads like a novel, so modifying that
could potentially be a nightmare. I decided to buy the fully
licensed version and I'm really glad I did. Sorry if I sound like
a commercial for the company; I don't work for them or stand to be
compensated in any way for recommending them. I just think this
menu system is the greatest thing to come along in a while.

Who knows how to thwart false charges? Lockergnomie Steve
Lafferty: "In a recent article over the PayPal issue, it was
stated that when using a credit card illegally, the owner of that
card is responsible for the first $50. However, sometging that
very few people know about is that there is a US Federal provision
in the banking industry called 'Reg E' (Regulation E / Electronic
Funds Transfer). This stipulates that all transactions will err in
favor of the customer (account holder). This means that if your
'bank card' is used without your permission, you are not
responsible for any of the charges. My suggestion is never to use
a credit card - and only use your bank debit card. That way, if
someone steals your number, you are not liable for any of the
charges." For more information, please refer to Section 205 on
FEDERALRESERVE.GOV. Obviously, this tip only applies to people
living in the USA. If you haven't been watching your statements
like a hawk lately, you'd be wise to start soon. Identity theft is
a growing concern. When my wallet was stolen, I found
IDENTITYTHEFT.ORG to be a godsend.

apologies for the possible silly question (i don't think it is, but),
but is Eircom's aDSL service NAT'ed?

and what implications would that have for VoIP? I know there are
difficulties with VoIP or connecting to clients connected to a NAT'ed

any help pointers would be helpful,

look at

There is a bit of circumstantial evidence - apparently some MT

dejanews/google groups showed a number of messages from him, clearly
hoping to contact girls, appearing in "alt.teens" and similar groups -
I just tried a Google Groups search on "Robert Moaby" and some of

If you copy the files from your disk to the c: partition and mark it as
active it should work ...

Yeah, I figured that, but it doesn't seem to ... well, if that's the case
I'll give it another go tonight, maybe come back with some error messages.

Just to clarify for those who didn't understand me initially - I have a
floppy drive installed, but it doesn't physically work. There's nowhere
handy to pick one up where I am, and I don't fancy waiting a few days for
one to arrive from Peats.

Thanks for the answers,
Ciaran.

You especially need io.sys, command.com and msdos.sys

your cd driver .sys and read the autoexec.bat and config.sys files for
hints on what you did with your boot floppy

Hi folks,
The situation is this: at home, I have a PC with 2 10Gig HDDs, and no
(working) floppy drive. I have been running Linux solely for the last
year, but recently got the urge to, among other things, play some of
my Windoze games. I normally install the windows partition using a
boot floppy which I have conveniently zipped up, but I haven't any way
of writing or reading a floppy.
So, how do I go about:
1. formatting a C: drive with system files (normally I would use
format /s c: from the floppy).
2. Installing the CDROM drivers (my bootdisk (I wrote it many years
ago) does this normally).
3. Booting from the partition?

I wiped all my linux partitions from the first drive and created
partitions for Windows (HDA1) Slackware and RedHat. I used cfdisk for
this. I made the first drive (hda) bootable. I then installed the
windows partition in LILO and reran lilo (installed in MBR). I copied
the contents of boot.zip to my new windows partition and tried to boot
it - all I get is a garbled line of squiggles.

Anyone any ideas? I can't think of anywhere in Athlone to get a new
floppy drive this evening...

Thanks,
Ciaran.

This is a bit of a messy solution but might be useful -

If you have an internal zip drive (not sure about external) and
you bios supports using a zip as floppy drive, you could
use a bootable zip disk with all the relevant dos utils.

Through daily use I've found that Mozilla and Opera Web browsers beat Internet Explorer because of two features: tabbed windows and built-in pop-up killers. But occasionally I hit a site that has features that don't work or has a messed up layout, so I have to launch IE to view it correctly. In the last couple of years, Web builders have used proprietary code from Microsoft in their sites, which Mozilla and Opera don't support.

I used to cover Web building, so I have plenty of insight into the problem. Using current, standard HTML and JavaScript, Web builders can make a Web site do almost anything that you could with Microsoft's proprietary code. The only things they can't do are goofy enhancements such as changing the browser scroll bar colors. To solve this compatibility problem, either Web builders have to take proprietary tags out of their sites or users have to use IE to view them. You can also enhance IE with utilities such as Secure IE to get the kinds of features offered by Mozilla and Opera, giving you the best of both worlds.

Who do you think should be solving problems of Web site incompatibility: Web builders, users, or browser manufacturers? Let me know at edit@download.com.

Last week I asked whether Audiogalaxy could survive only offering non-infringing files. Here are a few of your answers:

"Doomed. Completely, absolutely, utterly!"
Just about everyone agreed that Audiogalaxy is as dead as Napster.

"Each time a file-sharing service is canceled, a bunch of new ones appear."
But some people always find a silver lining.

"I might use a file-sharing service for a lot of things, particularly drivers, fixes, and patches."
A P2P network offering drivers seems like a great idea to me.

"I was an occasional Audiogalaxy participant (birthday CD burned to include songs that were hits the year you were born). Now I'll just opt for a birthday card and a bottle of wine."
I included this comment because I really like the birthday idea.

"It seems once again rather than release a file download site for music, at a fee per download, the music companies spend money on trying to stop download sites like Audiogalaxy."
With its popularity, file swapping should be an amazing opportunity for record companies, but they must not be smart enough to figure out how to make it work.

Reader Jack Macdonald has some advice for you would-be bards in the audience:

"You mention Karaoke being featured at Gnomedex and you
might want to point out to other Gnomies that they could
practice their Karaoke on my Red Hot
Karaoke Page site. There are the words and music for
more than 1100 songs available on the site and by
downloading the Yamanha Midiplug (a link is provided) they
can even change the key of the song to suit their voice
range as well as speed up or slow down the music to their
taste. In other words, to have the same experience as they
would have with professional Karaoke equipment but at no
extra cost! At this price (zero) a lot of gnomies going to
Gnomedex could be singing up a storm by being properly
prepared for your Karaoke."

Travel day on Wednesday as I head down to Ankeny, Iowa to
help out a former co-worker and avid Gnomie with some server
and networking stuff. The tough part is remembering
everything I'll need. It never fails, though. I always,
always, always forget something. I can make lists two weeks
in advance and I'll end up 30 miles down the road with a
handprint on my forehead when I come to the realization that
I left something important behind. What will it be this
time, I wonder? I'll let you know on Thursday.

Forwarding to Internet Address Fails

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q181636

Client inquires about the possibility of forwarding all
internal and Internet email to his AOL mailbox when he's out
of the office, and I figure it's going to be a piece of
cake. He recently acquired a new phone through Verizon along
with web access and a tie into his AOL mailbox, which was
the driving force behind this request. What I found was that
Internet email proved to be easy using a simple forwarding
rule, but none of the internal Exchange email was being sent
out to the Internet upon receipt, even though it appeared to
be included in the rule. As it happens, this is due to a
default configuration option on the Exchange 5.5 server that
prevents automatic replies/forwards from being sent to the
Internet using the Exchange Internet Mail Service. A quick
configuration change and restart of IMS will put things
right.

Stop the Presses

... The CD presses, that is. Microsoft has given in to
the greater good and delayed Windows 2000 Service Pack 3
indefinitely. Sure, it's mildly disappointing, but I applaud
the move. Instead of trying to downplay the previously
identified problems with Microsoft Installer (MSI) 2.0, the
service pack will be put on ice until the issues are
straightened out. Here's a quote for you... Good job,
Microsoft.

Windows XP System File Checker

Dean Truax mentioned the System File Checker as a
possible solution to my Windows Media Player problem under
Windows XP, and I did indeed run through it prior to
attempting an in-place upgrade, obviously with no
improvement. It's still worth a mention, however, in case
you're not familiar with what it's there for. As you're
probably aware, XP contains a file protection scheme that
will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or
altered in any way, ensuring that XP is kept in a stable
state. Sometimes this system can get a little out of whack,
and the SFC is meant to restore order. Note that any
hotfixes and other Microsoft-provided updates will be left
in place since they properly update the DLL Cache that is
used as the sanity check to determine if a system file has
been messed with. To access the SFC, simply launch a command
prompt and type "SFC" to display a list of options.

Consider This
Forwarded by JW

http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,72519,00.html

The next time you have a face-to-face with your elected
representatives, you might want to start asking about their
opinions on technology laws that are being proposed left and
right. Holding a public office seems to be introducing brain
death more frequently considering proposals by Senator Fritz
Hollings and now LA congressman Howard Berman. If Mr. Berman
gets his way, companies may very well be allowed to hack
into your systems without proof of provocation in order to
ensure that you are using their software according to the
stated rules. Mind you, if they cause colateral damage or
upset other systems, there isn't thing one you can do in
return. Nope, they'll have legal protection. This garbage is
seriously getting scary. If you think it won't be abused,
consider the case of Dimitry Skylarov when he publicly
pointed out eBook security problems with Adobe's software
and was promptly thrown in jail for his trouble under the
authority of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. He was
eventually released, but that doesn't make it any more
right.

apologies for the possible silly question (i don't think it is, but),

No - you get unfiltered access with a real (but dynamic) IP address.

and what implications would that have for VoIP? I know there are
difficulties with VoIP or connecting to clients connected to a NAT'ed
network from the internet wild (i.e. machines with static, real IPs)

You will probably suffer from the high latency of DLS lines. Typically,
you're talking about 50ms RTT to the local bas, which is pretty high.
If your voip application can handle this, then you're ok.

Nick

what's the deal with all this latency? it's not like that in other places
where I've used dsl. i read some story about it being done that way to
allow greater distances to be covered or something like that. however, my
knowledge of physics is really only newtonian, and I don't understand how
worsening latency could possibly improve the reliability of a 2000 foot
long piece of copper. Perhaps it has something to do with stretching the
time-space continuum? can someone explain this in words of five syllables
or less?

Dear readers,

If the majority of your photos are posed snapshots and
landscapes, a fast camera may not matter. But if you've ever

previous photo, the Leica Digilux 1 will appeal to you. We liked
it too, and we gave it an Editors' Choice award.Read the full story | Check prices -->

This new flash-based MP3 player blew us away right out of the

The last Palm OS 4 PDA

Check back later this week for our review of the Sony CLIE
PEG-T665C. This Palm OS 4.1 PDA has a built-in audio player
so that you can listen to MP3s on the go as well as a 66MHz processor for
better video playback. But with OS 5 expected before
Christmas, is now the time to buy a high-end Palm?

DivXbox

Microsoft has released a media player for its Xbox game
console that allows you to play movies recorded on CDs in the
DivX format.
True or false? Put your answer in the subject of an e-mail and send it to

Answer to the question from the last newsletter:

Plug your Pocket PC into the USB port on the new TiVo
Series2, and you can transfer recording onto the handheld to
watch while you're on the go.

No, this one's false. First of all, none of the proposed
"home-entertainment features" for the Series2 DVRs have been rolled
out yet. And so far, neither TiVo nor its partners have
proposed such a feature.

Quoting Greg Farrel (greg@netsoc.tcd.ie):

I'm looking to build a completely silent pc. It's gonna be a gateway for
a wireless network and will sit in my room (as my room is only
spitting distance from the chimney where i'll be mounting the aerial)
It has to be completely silent, or it'll do my nut. What do I need?

An old laptop would probably be ideal. That way, it comes with its own
UPS (the battery).

Some people strip down old 486 boxes, take out the hard drive, disable
the fans, and run the thing from just a floppy drive or a CDR you've
burned for the purpose.

Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. "I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,"
Campbell told The Post. "If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke."

So some guy failed to reach the source, but instead got spin doctor to
deny it. Wot, is he thick enough to expect official confirmation
that, yes, Blair is going around casting aspersions on Bush???

It's an amusing anecdote, I don't know if it's true or not, but certainly
nothing here supports the authoritative sounding conclusion "Status: False".

Through daily use I've found that Mozilla and Opera Web browsers beat Internet Explorer because of two features: tabbed windows and built-in pop-up killers. But occasionally I hit a site that has features that don't work or has a messed up layout, so I have to launch IE to view it correctly. In the last couple of years, Web builders have used proprietary code from Microsoft in their sites, which Mozilla and Opera don't support.

I used to cover Web building, so I have plenty of insight into the problem. Using current, standard HTML and JavaScript, Web builders can make a Web site do almost anything that you could with Microsoft's proprietary code. The only things they can't do are goofy enhancements such as changing the browser scroll bar colors. To solve this compatibility problem, either Web builders have to take proprietary tags out of their sites or users have to use IE to view them. You can also enhance IE with utilities such as Secure IE to get the kinds of features offered by Mozilla and Opera, giving you the best of both worlds.

Who do you think should be solving problems of Web site incompatibility: Web builders, users, or browser manufacturers? Let me know at edit@download.com.

Last week I asked whether Audiogalaxy could survive only offering non-infringing files. Here are a few of your answers:

"Doomed. Completely, absolutely, utterly!"
Just about everyone agreed that Audiogalaxy is as dead as Napster.

"Each time a file-sharing service is canceled, a bunch of new ones appear."
But some people always find a silver lining.

"I might use a file-sharing service for a lot of things, particularly drivers, fixes, and patches."
A P2P network offering drivers seems like a great idea to me.

"I was an occasional Audiogalaxy participant (birthday CD burned to include songs that were hits the year you were born). Now I'll just opt for a birthday card and a bottle of wine."
I included this comment because I really like the birthday idea.

"It seems once again rather than release a file download site for music, at a fee per download, the music companies spend money on trying to stop download sites like Audiogalaxy."
With its popularity, file swapping should be an amazing opportunity for record companies, but they must not be smart enough to figure out how to make it work.

You're a good bunch, you Penguins.

Today's GnomeVOICE really tells the story better than I can, but I'll give you a

quick summary. Through your efforts and compassion, reader Karl Steenblik has
found a new electronic home for the Foundation for Children and Youth With
Diabetes. I'll let Karl tell you which offered solution suited his needs. But,
with the volume of responses his request for help generated, it's almost
irrelevant. As I expected, we came together as a community and collectively
offered him many viable choices from which to pick a solution that would work
for the kids. The global scope of your concern and our collective ability to
effect a change has humbled me once again. Just when you start to get a little
callous about the 'Net ...

Accordingly, I'd like to sketch out an idea with you that can be an ongoing part

of Penguin Shell. It's an open discussion, really, about how we can further put
our technical skills (be they Linux or Windows skills) to work for a good

cause. I'm proposing that we start an organized volunteer effort, based in the
Penguin Shell readership, to provide volunteer technical services to worthwhile
charitable organizations. First, we need a name that clearly describes our purpose. Next, we need
volunteers with the time and ability to lend those skills to a good cause. Finally, we'll need some suggestions as to
the charitable organizations that are near and dear to your heart. Or,

maybe the organization is one you're already working with - one you're certain
can use some hands-on or remote volunteer help.

I'll start that ball rolling with a personal organizational suggestions - the Aicardi Syndrome Foundation.
Though I don't currently know their technical needs, I do know that the syndrome

is very rare - read "research and technical dollars are minimal." I'm sure we
can, as a group, provide them a way to fill existing technical holes.

That's just a suggestion. Feel free to use the mailto links above to make
others.

Over the next few weeks, I plan on modifying my current favorite blogging
program, GeekLog
to pull together a community project area where interested parties can gather,
coordinate and discuss whatever this project might become. I'll keep you posted
on the details.

In one of the earliest issues of Penguin Shell, I told a story about Emperor
Penguins - how they huddle together on the shore, knowing that their protection
from predators lies in sheer numbers. When one takes the leap into the water,
all the others follow; individual involvement for the good of the community.

Where could the analogy possibly be more fitting?

Quick Shortcuts

Linux is chock full of keyboard shortcuts that, when used, streamline the way
you use your system. Today's Tweaks are really user tweaks - built in shortcuts
you can use to maximize your Linux efficiency. You don't have to change your
system, just how you use what's already there. They're two tips that are quick
and very easy to learn and remember.

Got a cluttered console screen? Use [ctrl]+l to clear it. This does the
same thing as the clear command with far fewer keystrokes.

Do you want to log out of the console screen quickly? Use the [ctrl+d key

combination. This will log out the current user. If you're using bash and the
current user is not root, the [ctrl]+d combination will close the terminal
window, as well.

To me, any opportunity to save keystrokes is a good one. Better yet, if I can
avoid having to take my fingers from the keyboard to reach for the mouse, then
I've really saved some time. Though it's tough to quantify the time savings
using these keystroke combination shortcuts, intuitively I can tell you it's
substantial.

Maximum efficiency. That's what Tweaks are all about.

Kernel Configuration - Part XI

We've covered some fairly light topics to this point in the kernel configuration

series. Today's topic requires a bit of review. We'll discuss configuring block
devices in your kernel.

We've talked about the different types of devices in previous Penguin Shell
issues. Fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and
character devices. These draw their type names from the way they handle data.
Block devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally pre-set sizes of
data "blocks." Hard drives are block devices. They'll only write chunks of data
to storage. Thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly. Data
intended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your power
dies or you hard kill your machine. The system may still be accumulating data up

to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive.

Character devices, on the other hand, receive data in "streams," one character
at a time. Serial ports are a great example of character devices. They handle
data input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer then
committing the data.

The physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining why
they handle data as they do. A hard drive has to physically spin up to store or
retrieve data. You're actually changing the magnetic properties of the disc
surface when you store data. Consequently, a hard drive has to know where
there's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the disc under
the write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related data
together.

Character devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and forget

about it. The process is purely electrical rather than electrical and physical.
The serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your Palm Pilot. The
storage of the data is actually handled by the Palm itself, not a physical
storage device on the computer. There's no need to spin up a drive and account
for the data as is necessary with a hard drive. The Palm will also send a signal

back to the computer confirming receipt of data. That's an indication that
character devices often communicate in both directions, as well.

So, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the
system for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a predetermined
level, then write that data as a block, changing the physical properties of the
hard drive disc surface. Even though that's the highest level view of the
process, it still shows how difficult a process physical data storage really
is.

In the block device section, you'll find many options for physical data storage.

When configuring this section, it's crucial to know as much about your existing
hardware as possible. What type (brand) of hard drives are you using? What's the

interface to the machine - IDE, parallel, etc? Where is the drive located - on
the local machine or on a network-connected box? Because the variables are so
broad, it's nearly impossible to give you a stock configuration tip that will
work for your personal machine every time. I can tell you this - you will have
block devices (normally a hard drive and a floppy), and you need to answer as
many of the above questions as you can. Find out as much about these physical
devices as you can, and the configuration process will be relatively
painless.

A warning - you'll see more configuration tips like this as the series continues

to progress. I'll certainly make hands-on configuration recommendations where
possible. There are quite a few areas where I can make such recommendations.
However, where the variable set is as broad as block devices, much of the
legwork will be up to you.

Tomorrow, we'll talk about RAID and multi-device support in Linux.

rxLinux

http://www.fusionw3.com/rxlinux/

"The concept behind rxlinux is to centralise configuration and management of
multiple Linux servers. New servers can be deployed in minutes. A Web interface
is used to build custom ISO CD-ROMs dedicated for specific servers. Servers,
also called rxnodes, boot up from that CD-ROM and get the rest of the
configuration and software from a master server. No administration is done
directly on the nodes; everything is controlled from the master servers. When
the rxnode has finished booting up and all software is running, it is completely

independent from the rxmaster until the next reboot."

Having skimmed over the patent, it appears to be describing a sort of
image compression algorithm which gels more or less with the JPEG
mechanism. Since I don't quite understand how jpeg works (it's hard
math, and I'm just a dumb comp. eng.)

It's not hard math - jpeg is a straight block-based DCT with
quantisation - which is about the oldest image compression
algorithm out there, and I think certainly predates 1986. So I
really have no idea what they claim they've patented - doin DCT
on 8x8 blocks of an image, quantising the resulting coefficients,
or DCT in general? I'm extremely skeptical about this whole
story...

I don't know how exactly it
matches up to JPEG. I'm more curious as to whether it covers MPEG,
because it /is/ described in the context of video streams rather than
stills, and I had a vague impression that the MPEG and JPEG
compression techniques were similar. One of the patents it references
also seems to hint at MPEG.

MPEG 1, 2, 4 or 7? They're all very different compression
algorithms.

Anyway, here's to ogg, and hopefully the future mpeg4-standard
compression algorithm the project comes up with (fingers
crossed). And I wouldn't worry about the jpeg thing - in addition
the patent runs out next year, and I would suggest that having
failed to protect their IP for 15 years, as (iirc) is their

Microsoft reveals media XP details

Microsoft on Tuesday gave an official name to an upcoming version of Windows XP that aims to make the PC a permanent part of the home entertainment center.
Originally code-named Freestyle, this entertainment version of Windows--which will go by the name Windows XP Media Center Edition--will appear on new PCs and PC hybrids in time for the holidays, the company revealed on Tuesday. With Windows Media Center, consumers will be able to use a TV remote control to catalog songs, videos and pictures, as well as check TV listings.

HP trims Jornada unit in Singapore

Hewlett-Packard has shuffled employees out of its Jornada Pocket PC development unit in Singapore, as the company continues to cut costs following its merger with Compaq Computer.
Jornada products are developed in Singapore and will be phased out by year's end, with the exception of Jornada 720, which resembles a mini-notebook. The model will eventually be rebranded as an HP iPaq device.

There is a lot of C++ in the embedded world. With static object

differences disappear, but C++ gives a boost in development and
maintainability.

Agreed, not much difference there. With C it just doesnt seem as wrong to
be crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit
_that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter
as much in the embedded world.

And in the realtime space, or when you have data coming in at 2Gbit/sec
[fibrechannel], every cycle DOES count.

The real issue is compiler availability. Almost every embedded platform
has C cross-compilers. Many have C++ compilers. But there is still a
range of platforms that have the first but not the second. Or at least,
that was the story a few years ago.

Definately still very very true. C++ compilers are still a rarity.

This thread kind of surprises me... I started coding with C, then C++, and
moved on to Java... And, I think that:

Looks like a case of "MY experience is comprehensive, YOUR'S is
anecdotal, THEY don't know what they're talking about".

1. The people who pay the wages don't give a flyin' heck what programming
language you write things in... they just want it to work.

In my experience, they do care. It has to work certainly, and in
particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to
work on client's systems.

My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.

Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
service pack. Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
run C programs.

2. C and C++ forces the developer to solve problems such as memory
management over and over again.

Can't say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management
issues, apart from the fact that I frequently need > 4 GB.

It's about design patterns, architecture, high level stuff...

If your problem just requires application of a "design pattern" to solve,
then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.

I am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low
level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over
and over again...

You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time
on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't. Depends
entirely on the programmer, not the language.

3. Java is not just a programming language! It's also a platform...

Buzzword.

a monolithic set of API's or a crap load of different API's slicing
and dicing the same problems 50 different ways?

Unsupported assertion.

4. If you have a program of any type of high complexity written in C, you
can't possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within
the same magnitude of cost as Java....

Dunno. E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC
in a few minutes yesterday. Sure if it was badly designed it would be
10 times the size and harder to port. If it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder. Portable code is easy to port.
At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.

5. Makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a
person... Java, IMHO, reduces the dependence of these entities on the
individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer Java as it is
to reverse engineer C (large applications).

You can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get
some kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for
maintenance headaches ad infinitum.

6. Hardware is getting so fast that I'm not sure if the performance
difference between Java and C/C++ are relevant any more.

Whoah!!! Performance matters to me every day. (Right now I'm taking
time out to write email while waiting for a job to run). Sure I could
wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code
that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,
or I can do it now when very few people can.

The end goal is the scientific or business problem to be solved.

Yes.

And for those problems, languages such as Java, SmallTalk, and others
allow you to think more high level than low level. Thinking of bits
and bytes takes too much gray matter away from the real important
problems....

It's true! I admit everything! Mea maxima culpa! Working in C makes
me spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!
Not.

Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.

Why do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problems
over and over again [...]

Dunno, and frankly I don't see the relevance to the issue at hand.

I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever. Horses for
courses.

Bye,
Rob.

Banc of America Securities begins coverage of Power Integrations with a "market performer" rating in tech notes 7/16/02
Analyst Douglas Lee says the maker of power supply integrated circuits is building a market niche with a more efficient and reliable technology than traditional approaches to converting AC-to-DC power supplies. He also notes Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large, untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee suggests the stock is fairly valued. He believes shares of POWI are unlikely to rise much in the short term.POWER INTEGRATIONS 18.72 5.23%

I have a situation with a small network as follows:

A number of client workstations which are running VMware, each of which will
run a local copy of Samba (not the VMware autoinstalled version) to let
VMware access local linux disks.

An NIS/NFS server which will also run Samba to allow the VMware clients
access to its filesystems.

How can I set things up so that all the VMware clients (all running 'doze
98, possibly being upgraded in future to W2K) authenticate against the NIS
server's Samba ? I have read the Samab documentation in large quantities
down through the years but as I've never wanted to do anything like this, I
never paid much attention to all the stuff about domain controllers etc.
which I presume is what I will need to have running here.

I would also like, if at all possible, to have synchronisation of passwords
between the NIS domain and the NIS server's Samba with minimal manual
intervention.

Ideas, accompanied by annotated Samba configration files :-) , gratefully
received.

I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the the
choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE.
It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which
is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is
somewhat simpler to setup.

The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites
run OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of
IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.

So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a
significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?
If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever
on the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote
sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity
in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.

I could put the two PIII's into this box and re-compile X to use the
SSE/Katmai instructions in the PIII. I just don't thing it is worth replacing
two PII's with one PIII. I know that they are out-of-stock, and I do watch
the Buy-N-Sell regularly, but short of buying a full PIII system, I've not
had much luck.

Keep an eye on eBay. One annoyance of eBay is that many sellers state "will
ship to US only". However, I've found that if you ask nicely, they will
usually ship over here. For payments, either setup a paypal account or
post the seller a US dollar bank draft. I've got lots of little bits and
pieces that way (for example, finally got my hands on a rackmount kit for
my DECserver 700 terminal server which I'd been looking for for ages, for
a total of US$15).

Later,

Has anyone used (successfully!) a fat undelete program on Linux ?

Something like a simple version of the norton disk tools would be fine.
Actually, most likely the MS DOS "undelete" program would do...

I am trying to manage the email for a domain which I have hosted with
hosting365, and am trying to get the whole email send and receive thing
working nice and easily.
At the moment I have configured Fetchmail to poll the different pop3
mailboxes and deliver the mail accordingly, although it appears that I have
to have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop3 mailbox.
This could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, but
It would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mail
from the different mailboxes, and then deliver it locally according to the
"To:" header instead of the pop3 mailbox it came from.
The other issue I am having is sending outgoing mail. I have been trying to
use sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and
when the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have
checked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how
to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail. Do any of
the outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'
configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration
files like sendmail.

Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated. There
are only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for
scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me
fine.

Thanks,

David.

MARINE AQUARIUM
Version: 0.99.0
File size: 3MB
License: Free to try; $12.95 to buy

As the name suggests, this program puts an incredibly
realistic aquarium of saltwater fish on your screen. You can

track over time to watch how it adapts to its environment.

3. The Week in Wares

IN MULTIMEDIA AND DESIGN:

QUICKTIME
Version 6.0
File size: 402K
License: Free
Minimum requirements: Mac OS 8.6/9.x or Mac OS X

The latest version of Apple's premiere media application
supports the increasingly popular MPEG-4 codec for high-
quality, highly compressed video, as well as modern formats
such as AAC (Advanced Audio Codec) and JPEG 2000. It also
provides skip protection, an enhanced user interface with a
more intuitive and useful Favorites menu, new developer APIs,
and other useful features such as support for Flash 5 files.

CARTOON EDITOR
Version: 1.2.1
File size: 2.38MB
License: Free
Minimum requirements: Mac OS X

Cartoon Editor won't turn you into a gifted cartoonist
overnight. But what this graphic editor will do is make quick
work of creating short QuickTime movies and animated GIFs--
and for OS X freeware, it doesn't get much better than that.
Cartoon Editor lets you draw or import JPEGs and GIFs, which
you can then manipulate with a set of tools that lets you
group, scale, duplicate, ghost, and all sorts of other useful
cartoony things. The program's Java2D foundation allows for
some surprisingly powerful features, like gradients,
antialiasing, splining, and transparencies.

phase for a particular date and identify topographical
features on the moon using a built-in catalog of those that
have been surveyed by astronomers and astronauts. This update
incorporates improved help features and a few bug fixes.

edit your syntax line by line; build image maps and forms

Reader Jack Macdonald has some advice for you would-be bards in the audience:

"You mention Karaoke being featured at Gnomedex and you
might want to point out to other Gnomies that they could
practice their Karaoke on my Red Hot
Karaoke Page site. There are the words and music for
more than 1100 songs available on the site and by
downloading the Yamanha Midiplug (a link is provided) they
can even change the key of the song to suit their voice
range as well as speed up or slow down the music to their
taste. In other words, to have the same experience as they
would have with professional Karaoke equipment but at no
extra cost! At this price (zero) a lot of gnomies going to
Gnomedex could be singing up a storm by being properly
prepared for your Karaoke."

Travel day on Wednesday as I head down to Ankeny, Iowa to
help out a former co-worker and avid Gnomie with some server
and networking stuff. The tough part is remembering
everything I'll need. It never fails, though. I always,
always, always forget something. I can make lists two weeks
in advance and I'll end up 30 miles down the road with a
handprint on my forehead when I come to the realization that
I left something important behind. What will it be this
time, I wonder? I'll let you know on Thursday.

See You in August, Randy Nieland

Forwarding to Internet Address Fails

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q181636

Client inquires about the possibility of forwarding all
internal and Internet email to his AOL mailbox when he's out
of the office, and I figure it's going to be a piece of
cake. He recently acquired a new phone through Verizon along
with web access and a tie into his AOL mailbox, which was
the driving force behind this request. What I found was that
Internet email proved to be easy using a simple forwarding
rule, but none of the internal Exchange email was being sent
out to the Internet upon receipt, even though it appeared to
be included in the rule. As it happens, this is due to a
default configuration option on the Exchange 5.5 server that
prevents automatic replies/forwards from being sent to the
Internet using the Exchange Internet Mail Service. A quick
configuration change and restart of IMS will put things
right.

Stop the Presses

... The CD presses, that is. Microsoft has given in to
the greater good and delayed Windows 2000 Service Pack 3
indefinitely. Sure, it's mildly disappointing, but I applaud
the move. Instead of trying to downplay the previously
identified problems with Microsoft Installer (MSI) 2.0, the
service pack will be put on ice until the issues are
straightened out. Here's a quote for you... Good job,
Microsoft.

Windows XP System File Checker

Dean Truax mentioned the System File Checker as a
possible solution to my Windows Media Player problem under
Windows XP, and I did indeed run through it prior to
attempting an in-place upgrade, obviously with no
improvement. It's still worth a mention, however, in case
you're not familiar with what it's there for. As you're
probably aware, XP contains a file protection scheme that
will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or
altered in any way, ensuring that XP is kept in a stable
state. Sometimes this system can get a little out of whack,
and the SFC is meant to restore order. Note that any
hotfixes and other Microsoft-provided updates will be left
in place since they properly update the DLL Cache that is
used as the sanity check to determine if a system file has
been messed with. To access the SFC, simply launch a command
prompt and type "SFC" to display a list of options.

Consider This
Forwarded by JW

http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,72519,00.html

The next time you have a face-to-face with your elected
representatives, you might want to start asking about their
opinions on technology laws that are being proposed left and
right. Holding a public office seems to be introducing brain
death more frequently considering proposals by Senator Fritz
Hollings and now LA congressman Howard Berman. If Mr. Berman
gets his way, companies may very well be allowed to hack
into your systems without proof of provocation in order to
ensure that you are using their software according to the
stated rules. Mind you, if they cause colateral damage or
upset other systems, there isn't thing one you can do in
return. Nope, they'll have legal protection. This garbage is
seriously getting scary. If you think it won't be abused,
consider the case of Dimitry Skylarov when he publicly
pointed out eBook security problems with Adobe's software
and was promptly thrown in jail for his trouble under the
authority of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. He was
eventually released, but that doesn't make it any more
right.

You're probably right, mine's just the same but with the cream added to the

Falling asleep at the wheel is no laughing matter. Still, it kinda
happened with yesterday's
tip. I forgot to mention that the String value's label
is "Logging" (sans quotes). That was almost like a cliffhanger,
eh? The oversight was totally my fault. I've been thinking about
asking Gretchen and Brian to help with future reviews. Don't be
surprised if that happens soon. I'm sure you'd welcome a female
perspective on this stuff, right? She helped one of our landlords
pick a paint color for the "office" wall this evening. Does that
qualify her to talk about cool stuff that we find for you on the
Internet? You betcha. Let's see how she does with the drapes and
rugs. I have a feeling I'll be the one tweaking furniture layout.
Shouldn't be too much of an issue - yet. I wonder if Ikea has an
affiliate program?

I've mentioned how Yahoo Mail's beta is mangling our commas, but
did you know that it's also (possibly) rewriting your e-mail? If
you send an HTML message to someone who has a yahoo.com account,
something may get lost in the translation. Try sending this
sentence: "My medieval mocha has an expression to evaluate."
Again, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results will
surprise you. As far as I can tell, they're doing this to stop any
scripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit
Marion Schroll for making me aware of the "problem." It's kinda
funny, in a weird sort of way. Not that I would want anything I
send changed in any way, shape, or form. It begs the question:
what next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give them a bit, and
they just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone's throw
away.

I really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: "What is
this crazy business with the broadband metering? What they
advertise doesn't seem to be what you get. Now that I'm forking
out $60 per month for a supposed metered rate of 640 down / 320
up, I'm feeling clueless and left out in the cold. Not sure what
I'm paying for, not sure what's going on at the office, not sure
if I'm capped, not sure if I'm getting ripped off! Can you help me
out here? I'm feeling lied to; why can't I download 'til my 40 gig
is full? That is what they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT
I was paying for. I want consistent speed - is this too much to
ask?" It's not too much to ask the question, but it's probably too
much to get the answer. I'm facing the same dilemma right now,
even though cable-based connectivity isn't available in my area.
Expect more and more "filters" to be put in place as time marches
on. Watch those EULAs, folks.

See You in August, Chris Pirillo

Directory Lister v0.5.2 [547k] W9x/2k/XP FREE

http://freeware.prv.pl/

{List directory contents} When I was younger, I'd get so frustrated at those games where you'd have to pick out all of the subtle differences between two pictures. I'd always end up with one or two that I just could never see. When I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my computer, I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing. Not only does Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories, it will also let you save the output to an HTML file. This is great for web developers who want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and uploading it to their website. As an added bonus, Directory Lister also shows the date, time, and attributes of the files in your directory, making it easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories.

Web Calendar [25k] W2k/XP FREE

http://members.lycos.co.uk/bleucanard/WebCalendar.htm

{Web page reminder} Surfing the web as much as I do, I'll occasionally run into a site or page that commits the horrendous faux pas of displaying an "Under Construction" banner. I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow encounter it later, or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this handy-dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week. The same technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning, or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week. Now, I will have no excuse for missing the DVD release of "Lord of the Rings"...

CollegeBAR v8.0 [5.9M] W9x/2k/XP US$20
Unearthed by Shawn Verrall

http://www.pracx.com/collegebar.asp

{Mix your own drinks} When I was in college, my room used to be known as "The Bar." It may have had something do with my L-shaped desk that resembled a bar, and the fact that I had seen the movie Cocktail too many times and wanted to be a bottle-flipping bartender. I never achieved my goal of being the world's best geek bartender, but maybe with College Bar I could have. College Bar contains recipes for over 11,600 drinks. With an online update feature, you can download new drinks as they become available... or you can add your own creative concoctions to the database! College Bar also has a calculator to determine someone's blood alcohol level... drink responsibly, folks. As an added bonus, you can load some of your favorite party pictures into the program and you'll see a slide show of those pictures - a great way to remember the good times... unless you don't remember experiencing them in the first place, that is. Dude, where's my car?

I am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here... just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.

Hi All,
I'm trying to set up the following:

1. A Linux server running with a modem for internet connectivity and an
ethernet card for LAN connectivity
2. Other LAN pcs with ethernet cards, using the Linux server for
DNS/DHCP etc.

Basically, I want to route any non LAN traffic through the ppp0.

I've got some of the way, but like a similar post earlier about modem
problems, when I am connected to the internet with eht0 up, the routing
is all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp0 (eh0 must be the
default route or something).

Is there standard "out of the box" Linux tools that will carry out
portmapping on behalf of the LAN PCs ? (I'm planning on non routable
addresses 192.168.x.x for the LAN, routed outwards via the ppp0
interface).

Can someone point me at the right HOWTOs or routing documentation I need
to follow ?
Thanks,
Dermot.

I had posted previously about the 2.4 kernel using iptables I ran nmap
against. The IPID sequence generation was all zeros. Someone said this was
indicative of earlier kernels but was fixed about 2.4.5 version. Since I'm
running the latest what is causing this? I ran nmap against a 2.2 kernel
using chains and it had better results than the stock 2.4 kernel.

If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well.
Register for Gnomedex today!

Of the comments I received on AppleScript, every single one suggested I
start with the basics, for that reason, I'm going to take things
step-by-step, following my own learning process and progressing to
gradually more difficult concepts. Despite having experience in
programming, using a variety of languages, I initially found AppleScript
to be quite intimidating -- mostly because something about the Script
Editor seems less than intuitive. If you've already been dabbling in
scripting, the first few columns on the subject will definitely be
targeted at novices, but I want to everyone to have the chance to get
up to speed.

I'm off to the
Shareware Industry Conference for the remainder of the week,
where it's looking like the selection of stuff for Mac users will be very
bleak. I believe the organization is targeted more toward the Windows
community in general and any shareware developer with enough cash to get
there is probably going to be in New York for MacWorld. I'll be missing
out on the Web cast of Steve Jobs speech, which is scheduled to take place
while I'm in the car, but at least I'll be able to catch the details at
other Mac sites when I get to St. Louis. Internet access for the trip is
being provided by Crosspaths.net, which is one of the few dialup services
I've found that can be configured to relay my Lockergnome mail so that I
can still function on the road. I tested the service on my iBook this
evening just to be sure.

With some luck, I may be able to get Internet access from the highway, via
my Kyocera 6035, and see what Jobs had to say before I get to St. Louis.
Unfortunately, there's no support for OS X yet with the 6035, so I can't
use the unlimited nights and weekends to dial the Web from my laptop. A
landline will probably be more sensible anyway. Check my blog for some
updates on the trip, Lori's attending too and I'm sure she'll be taking
lots of photos, as usual.

Seven themes, two board sizes and your choice of difficulty levels, makes
this a game for the entertainment addict in all of us. The object is to
clear the board of all icons, removing them in matching clusters of two
or greater at a time. Clearing the screen awards bonus points and scoring
awards clearing of larger clusters. Nothing gets killed, there's no
swearing, but you'll find yourself addicted to the mindless fun anyway --
not to mention you can feel safe sharing this with kids.

Samba Sharing Package v1.5 [8.3MB] OS X FREE

http://xamba.sourceforge.net/ssp/

It remains to be seen whether 10.2 will render this type of application
unnecessary, but for those out there without the cash to spend on DAVE,
for small office or home networking of Mac/PC mixed environments, this
is the only real alternative. Installation and configuration is almost
painless, making it easy for your Windows machine to see apps on your
Mac with little difficulty. The interface, like most OS X GUI apps, is
quite easy to navigate, including user management, connection
management, and share configuration into a convenient Prefernce pane.

GnomeSCRIPT
Technically speaking, you could do most of your script writing in a text editing
application like TextEdit, but ultimately you've got to compile it in the Script
Editor, so you might as well start there. The Script Editor is located in the
AppleScript subfolder of your Applications folder. Opening the application for
the first time reveals a small window divided in to two sections, Description
and the actual scripting pane, separated by a group of buttons.

Ignore the buttons for the moment and concentrate on the two text panes. The
Description pane is where you label your script, so you can remember later what
it does. This is also the place you denote the key combination that will invoke
your script. If you choose to save your script as an executable application, the
information in the description will show up in the start up screen.

The second pane is where the magic happens. In this pane you will be telling
applications to do specific tasks when your script runs. The format for scripting
is fairly linear. You either start your script at the top most level drilling
down, until you actually reach the application or object you want to manipulate
with your script, or you take the reverse approach manipulating things from the
bottom up. Telling the "Applications" folder to tell its "Jake" subfolder to tell
the application "Jake's Media Player," located in that folder to do something
could also be written by telling the script to access "Jake's Media Player"
located in the "Jake" subfolder of the "Applications folder, The upcoming example
will make this a bit more clear.

GnomeTIP

Traditionally, Mac OS has always placed a link to various disks in use on the
desktop, which can be convenient, but is no longer necessary with the Finder
only a Command+Tab away in the Dock. My personal desktop is usually cluttered
with files I've downloaded from the Internet, so I can never find anything
when my desktop is in plain sight, the Finder is the only way I stay organized.
For desktop slobs like me, or for neat freaks who want nothing on the desktop,
OS X includes three handy options for keeping disks in their place. Open the
Finder Preferences window and uncheck the three checkboxes under Show these
items on the Desktop. You'll have more space for other icons to clutter the
desktop or in the case of you clean folk, you'll have nothing at all.

but that's just stupid. microsoft s/w covers a subset of applications

You know it's stupid - I know it's stupid. Nonetheless, Microsoft has tried
to spread FUD about the viral nature of the GPL to make CEO/CIO level people
(often not the most technically clueful, even the CIOs) fear that if they so
much as use a Linux box, as, say, a print server, they'll have to make their
company's entire IP public. (I don't think Microsoft said precisely what I

( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the "snapshot"

Rhapsody rules

I never thought Id say it, but Im changing my tune about subscription music services.

When MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late last year, I was unimpressed. Their music catalogs were limited, the software was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.coms Rhapsody, a subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure recordings from all five major labels. And now Im rethinking my stance.

Rhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download them to a portable player, youll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge, and you cant download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download MP3s? Let me know at edit@download.com

Here are some representative responses from last week's question on who should take the blame for Web sites not being compatible in every browser:

"Web builders should be doing as much as possible to support the broadest possible usage by their target audience"
A little over half the responses put the onus of compatibility on builders.

"There are far less browser makers than there are Web builders and users. So it doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?."
After Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this response makes the best argument.

"The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to only one browser."
Few responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall into the Web user category.

"As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no matter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does."
Quite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while noting the difficulty of testing in every browser.

"Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the remaining tiny minority has to be justified."
A few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share browser.

Hi All,
The serial number in our hosts files on our DNS server has gone
corrupt e.g. 2002082999999999901 should be 20002082901.
Its okay to set this back to todays date but I understand that our
secondary and terninary DNS servers will only update from the master
hosts file if the master host serial number is greater than the current
serial number in the hosts file.
Is there any way I can reset this on the secondary and terninary DNS
servers?

Once you have the serial changed on the master DNS server, remove
the appropiate zone(s) on your slaves, and refresh your DNS servers.

Bind has a special case, if you set the serial to '0' I think. DNS &
Bind should have something on that.

kevin

Having skimmed over the patent, it appears to be describing a sort of
image compression algorithm which gels more or less with the JPEG
mechanism. Since I don't quite understand how jpeg works (it's hard
math, and I'm just a dumb comp. eng.) I don't know how exactly it
matches up to JPEG. I'm more curious as to whether it covers MPEG,
because it /is/ described in the context of video streams rather than
stills, and I had a vague impression that the MPEG and JPEG
compression techniques were similar. One of the patents it references
also seems to hint at MPEG.

Let's all use PNG, eh? *cough* *wheeze*

Cheers,
Waider.

Your actual serial number is 1519761310 - from a dig I've just done.

Try resetting the zone number to 2002082901 - some of your secondaries seem
to have a serial number below that, so they clearly regard 1519761310 as
being less than 2002082601.

That should enable them to pick up the new zonefile.

As far as I can remember, the fact that the IPID is zero was introduced into
2.4 was to introduce correct behaviour, i.e. in the case where it is not
needed, it is set to zero. This was discussed on bugtraq a while
ago....lemme see...
http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/archive/bugtraq/2002/03/msg00372.html shows a
message from nmap's author on the subject. The only thing having IPID==0
achieves is that you have one more criteria on which to base your OS
fingerprint which isn't really much of a problem to be honest.

Stop worrying about it :)

Subject: [ILUG] nmap results

I had posted previously about the 2.4 kernel using iptables I ran nmap
against. The IPID sequence generation was all zeros. Someone said this was
indicative of earlier kernels but was fixed about 2.4.5 version. Since I'm
running the latest what is causing this? I ran nmap against a 2.2 kernel
using chains and it had better results than the stock 2.4 kernel.

Brooklyn Bridge for sale! No kidding! The town of Brooklyn,
Iowa has a bridge that they are selling on Ebay, so if you have a need for such
a structure, or just want to have the right to say you
legitimately purchased the Brooklyn Bridge, here's your
opportunity! Seriously, this is not a prank!

Ever since I was down toward Des Moines last week and had
a cup-o-java with Jake at Starbucks, I've been craving
coffee. I can't see myself turning into a coffee junkie like
Chris, but it's just weird that this would happen, being
that my extent of coffee drinking has usually been limited
to the severe need for a quick morning wake-up or in an
effort to keep warm on cold mornings when out in the field
back in my Marine Corps days.

As time has gone on, I've been trying to cut back on the
typical geek vices of sugar and caffeine, but I can't drink
coffee straight. It has to be sweet, and what's the point of
drinking coffee if there's no caffeine? Enter Splenda. An
artificial sweetener that has finally made it to Waterloo,
Iowa. Most of what Diana and I use sugar for has been
modified to use Splenda instead, with good results.
Hopefully this coffee thing is just a temporary kick like it
usually is. I have to brush my teeth after a cup or two from
the nasty breath. It's fun to test out the dragon-breath on
the cat to see just how bad it really is. If Bootes sniffs a
couple of times, it's not too bad, but if she instantly
recoils, time to employ the Sonicare for a couple of
minutes. See what you've started, Jake?

See You in August, Randy Nieland

Exchange Titanium Details Emerge

http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/07-15exchangeqa.asp

Oracle recently announced their intention to compete
directly with Microsoft Exchange, even accepting Outlook as
an email client. In what seems like a direct response, we're
handed details of the 2003 release of Exchange Titanium.
I've always liked what Exchange can do, so I'm certainly
looking forward to seeing what the new features will be all
about, but I'm also interested in what Oracle will be
bringing to the table. Better email functionality, control
and security are the name of the game, whoever ends up being
the vendor of choice. Included in this Q&A is a screenshot
of what Outlook may look like once Office 11 is released.
It's an interesting concept shot, showing some new ways they
plan to handle email views. It doesn't say anything for
Exchange functionality, but it's worth noting regardless.

Better Pocket PC Audio
Unearthed by David Spencer

http://home.adelphia.net/~mdukette/downloads.html

An open source project is bringing a different spin to
audio and video on Pocket PCs, and my first impression is...
cool! I like what they're working on here. I decided to wipe
out my Jornada yesterday, so I haven't done a direct
comparison between the iPaq 3870 and Jornada 565 for audio
quality using this player, which has an equalizer built-in,
but it definitely has potential judging from how it sounds
on the iPaq right out of the gate. Definitely give this a
peek if you're one of those that likes to play audio and
video on a Pocket PC. Quite a few different versions are
supported, so you should be able to find something
appropriate to your device.

Where's Java?

http://news.com.com/2100-1001-944053.html

Three readers asked me about this very thing this week,
and it's something you should probably know about if you use
Windows XP. Microsoft didn't bundle the Java Virtual Machine
with Windows XP, and since the release of XP, the JVM has been avaialble via the
Windows Update site as a "convenience" to users. Part of Sun's legal
complaints surrounding how Microsoft has handled Java was that Microsoft did not have the right to
distribute their implementation via the web, though
they did have licensing rights to include it with Windows.
So essentially, Microsoft has things backwards, as it seems.
Well, to avoid further web distribution arguments, Microsoft
has yanked the JVM from the Windows Update site and all
other areas of Microsoft's web site. Microsoft is still
planning to include Java with Windows XP Service Pack 1.
You'll have to plan for Java support accordingly, as SP1 is
still a ways off and you can't get it from Microsoft at this
point. If you need it for a new installation of Windows XP
in the short term, Sun will gladly provide you with their
own distibution.

Another Xeon Deal
Served up by Warren Dugas

http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?sku=C170-1032%20P

I mentioned a really nice deal on Compaq Evo W6000 dual-
Xeon workstations a few weeks back, which I know several of
you took advantage of, but the $1999 price tag likely scared
off many others. If you still want to get into a Xeon, check
this one out. TigerDirect is offering an Evo W8000
workstation with a single 1.7GHz processor, 18.2GB 15,000rpm U160
drive, 48x CD-ROM and licenses for both Windows 2000 Pro and
NT 4.0 Workstation for $699.99. Note that there is NO memory
and no video card included, so you'll have to scrounge those for
yourself, but it really is a pretty good deal, on the whole.
Also realize that these systems take RAMBUS memory, which
will add a bit of cost, so be sure you know what you're
getting - a wicked-fast workstation, to be sure! Expandability is also quite amazing with these machines.

Recommend It!

oh, and they can't forge confirm messages. the confirm message system
works something like this:

message goes in the pending q and is assigned an id.
that id is encrypted and used to create the from address of the
outgoing confirm mail - kevin+confirm+kghdsfg@ie.suberic.net
only a message to that address will work to free the message from

STUDENT LIFE BEGINS WITH LINUX
by
John Sterne

The launch last month of a marketing special interest group by the
Irish Linux Users Group (ILUG) - open source and marketing, it
seems, might not be mutually exclusive concepts - has already
sparked an interesting initiative at University College Cork. When
the new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will
be offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.

ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a
training class for staff at the UCC computer science department.
Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the
Linux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish
universities.

The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme
that aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source
style of computing. The Linux distributor runs an 'educational
channel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software
with its operating environment and offering networked support
services to eligible applicants. This scheme was originally designed
to suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to
schools and universities throughout the world.

Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance
features and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to
master on personal systems.

The Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red
Hat Ireland. Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial
services for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000. Until now
its involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,
although it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in
Europe that offer consulting or technical support services.

David Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,
sees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take
a more proactive approach. In the last three months, he notes, his
office in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish
companies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced
some to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.

-------------
Many thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.

Regards
L.

I've been playing with an old Dell OptiPlex5110 and decided to attempt to
build a PentiumMMX optimised Linux on it.

To start, I installed the bare minimum Debian system for compiling programs.

Next I built a custom kernel, since most CPU optimizations are best suited to
the kernel code.

Next I built X4.2.0 from sources, especially since X make a lot of use of
matrixes and can also benifit from MMX optimizations. Since the first build,
I've been encouraged to play with the CVS of both XFree86 and the DRI stuff,
so I will be re-building X once we get some bugs worked out.

Finally I built KDE3.0BETA1 from sources I had, again to take full advantage
of the MMX processor.

Can anyone recommend other minimum tools that I should re-build to get even
more improvements in system performance? I know that not all packages can, or
do benefit from being built on PentiumMMX rather than the i386 that Debian
compiles to, but have I covered everything that CAN benefit?

I am wondering if the C, and other libraries should be re-built? Can they
take advantage of the Pentium and MMX instructions for system performance?
And would this require re-building gcc as well?

I realise that not everything can benefit from re-compiling. I.E. I doubt I
would see much system improvement if I re-compile bash, but things like the
kernel, X and KDE should improve performance.

On a related note, I know I've mentioned here before, but I'm still looking
for a Slot 1 550Mhz PIII. My regular system is a Dual PII350 and the 440BX
M/B can take PIII's. I managed to get my hands on one. If I could get another
I could put the two PIII's into this box and re-compile X to use the
SSE/Katmai instructions in the PIII. I just don't thing it is worth replacing
two PII's with one PIII. I know that they are out-of-stock, and I do watch
the Buy-N-Sell regularly, but short of buying a full PIII system, I've not
had much luck.

Cheers,

John Gay

Jobs touts OS X, iPods, iMac

NEW YORK--Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs on Wednesday defended the company's switch to the Mac OS X operating system and unveiled new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.
Jobs used his keynote speech at the Macworld trade show here to make a flurry of other announcements as well, such as details about new syncing software, the next update to OS X and the end of free iTools.

The most dramatic announcement focused on iPod. The new players include ones built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system.

Scient files for Chapter 11

Internet consulting firm Scient has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and agreed to sell certain assets to a professional services firm.
The deal calls for Salt Lake City-based SBI to hire some of Scient's employees and to provide up to $4.9 million in financing, pending completion of the asset acquisition.

Scient has been struggling for some time now. Once a dot-com darling, the company recently approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split.

The company and SBI said they expect the bankruptcy court to approve the deal, adding that financing "will allow Scient to continue to deliver services to its clients without interruption until court approval of SBI's acquisition is received."

Yahoo Mail puts words in your mouth

What does Yahoo Mail have against mocha?
That's what users of the company's free e-mail service may be wondering if they try to send a message using the word "mocha" and discover that while in transit, "mocha" mysteriously changes to "espresso."

To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as "mocha" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.

The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as "Web enhanced" can contain JavaScript instructions that can run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.

Unisys splits Intel server line

Unisys, a specialist in high-end servers, is coming out with a new lower-cost line of Intel-based servers as it gears up to promote the Itanium 2 chip.
Unisys' new Aries servers accommodate as many as 16 Itanium 2 or Xeon processors and cost between $75,000 and $300,000, said Mark Fevertson, Unisys' vice president of server marketing. It joins the Orion line, which can use up to 32 Xeon or Itanium 2 processors and has been on sale for about two years at a cost between $140,000 and $700,000.

Microsoft sweetens Mac Office offer

With sales of its Office suite for Mac OS X falling short of projections, Microsoft plans on Wednesday to announce a rebate for those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac.
The promotion, which runs through Sept. 30, entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software. Microsoft is also offering two new pieces of downloadable software: one that lets Palm handhelds synchronize directly with Office v. X and another that lets the Macintosh view programs running on a Windows PC or server.

New chip may portend ATI comeback

ATI, once the leader in graphics chips, will launch its comeback bid this week with a new chip that experts say could put the company back in front in terms of performance.
The Markham, Ontario-based company on Thursday will unveil the details of the Radeon 9700, a desktop graphics chip based on a new architecture that will provide greater realism when it comes to 3D images, according to sources.

The fastest versions of the new chips will offer considerably higher performance than Nvidia's current GeForce4 roster, giving ATI the edge with gamers as well as PC makers, analysts said. And even after Nvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999--comes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two will remain close.

Does anyone know when Redhat 8.0 is going to be released?
I have seen some ISO images of it around and I am trying to work out
if it's near release.

Null, the third beta was out last week.

It'll be an interesting release. Gnome 2.0, and GCC 3.2 - both very new,
large projects.

I'd not be putting it on any production machines for a while...

Though many say "RedHat X.0 releases are rubbish" - it's worth baring in
mind that they jump a release when the underlying archtechture changes, not
just the installer, so they are .0 for a reason.

Answer to the question from the last newsletter:

Plug your Pocket PC into the USB port on the new TiVo
Series2, and you can transfer recording onto the handheld to
watch while you're on the go.

No, this one's false. First of all, none of the proposed
"home-entertainment features" for the Series2 DVRs have been rolled
out yet. And so far, neither TiVo nor its partners have
proposed such a feature.

There are two open alternatives that I can think of
that don't appear to have been mentioned
elsewhere in this thread.

One is Firebird (this is my personal favourite).
It is http://FirebirdSQL.org and you can
purchase support contracts here
www.ibphoenix.com.

Indeedy - I had never even heard of firebird until we started a new job
last week with a client who uses it. So we popped it onto a box
downstairs and wow - it is fast. Comes with some lovely client tools
also. Supports all the db goodies, transactions, stored procedures,
triggers.

It's really amazing to think how much they've got
out of a db that is only 4 MB in size - that's 10
times smaller than the Oracle *_client_*.

Having said all of the above, Oracle is really
a super product, but ya pays ya money...

IBM's db2 is another cheaper alternative to Oracle. Free single
developer license downloadable from their website.

Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and
BBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!

Of course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this
collection!

I had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don't do Windows, and the
albums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it's own wav file, 25
Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive.

Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to
attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it
doesn't
crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them
completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!

xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does not

have any position control so you just have to listen to the album from start

to finish.

file has this to say about them:

johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV
beatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM,
stereo 22050 Hz
johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ ls -l beatles/SGT.WAV
-r-xr-xr-x 1 johngay johngay 53334900 Sep 27 2001 beatles/SGT.WAV

And this is SGT Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good,
considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in
stereo.

What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for
xmms. I'm jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange
compressed wav's that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but
would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums
and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV
plugin, but it does not recognise these either.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Cheers,

John Gay

Greetings from Download.com!
No software developer is immune to bugs. Even the cleanest code
will have to go through a debugging process, but some debuggers
are more efficient than others. Check out Download.com's
complete collection of debugging tools here, and put away the
can of Raid.

Also this week, we've got some very handy utilities. First,
there's Chilkat, a cool zip/unzip ActiveX control that you can
add to any language with ActiveX support (which is most major
ones). But my personal favorite is VB-PowerWrap, a simple tool
that takes all the far-flung bits and pieces of your Visual Basic
masterpiece and socks them all away into one executable file
for ease of distribution.

Chilkat Zip 6.0.2
Need to add zip capability to your apps? Create and
decompress zip archives with the Chilkat Zip ActiveX
control. The control provides easy access to individual files

the zip using a wildcard string and then extract individual
files or files matching a pattern. Files can be unzipped to
any directory, and the control's memory management allows any
size file to be compressed or decompressed in a constant
memory footprint. The control allows you to compress directly
from memory buffers or strings, as well as add multiple files
with wildcarding. There's even a real-time progress monitor
for zip and unzip operations. Chilkat supports Active Server

Here's a weird and wacky problem:

I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I
tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved
pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd
used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I
was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having
somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows
and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking.
Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery.
Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where
there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up
and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection
of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.

This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.

Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel
that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?

Cheers,
Waider.

and here's an answer from 1989. for those perceptive folks in the
audience you'll note that it makes no reference to a windows icons.

so yeah, unrm would be nice, but obviously it's not a simple problem.
millions of lines of code, hundreds of projects, no unrm. heck, the
hurd will probably release 1.0 before unrm shows up.

So what this tells us is:
1) There are very few new ideas.
2) Problems exists until someone gets annoyed enough to actually fix them
rather than find bizarre ways to solve the problem.
3) I have too much creative time on my hands with not enough productive
time.

From which we can infer that no work on unrm will be happening on my
computer for a long time.

On Sat, Oct 05, 2002 at 06:06:14PM +0100, Padraig Brady mentioned:
OK I'm upgrading vorbis on my machine and I'm getting
the following:

# rpm -U libvorbis-* vorbis-tools-1.0-1.i386.rpm
error: failed dependencies:
libvorbisfile.so.0 is needed by SDL_mixer-1.2.0-4
libvorbisfile.so.0 is needed by xmms-1.2.5-7
libvorbisfile.so.0 is needed by tuxracer-0.61-5

This is because the new libvorbis.rpm only has libvorbisfile.so.3
So is this a problem in the other packages depending on
a specific version (libvorbisfile.so.0) rather than on the
generic libvorbis.so ?

This is a pain.

The only way you can resolve this, to my knowledge is to download the
original libvorbis rpm and the new one. Remove the old one, then do:

rpm -Uvh libvorbis-*

RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time,
and does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library already
installed is beyond me.

| From: "John P. Looney"
|[ ... ]
| That's something that POSIX would do - make every platform as
| equally broken, rather than standing up and saying "how about
| we try & make everyone better".

eh? POSIX doesn't "do" anything. POSIX is a de jour
specification for a voluntary minimal implementation to
encourage software transportability. no-one, absolutely
no-one, has or ever had to implement POSIX or be restricted
to POSIX. commercial considerations et.al. may encourage
some "POSIX-compatibility", but that's a freely-made choice.

IMHO, the process's weakness is a general rule --- which
has been ignored on occasion --- to only consider "formal"
submissions of "proven" technologies. that translates into
specifying more-or-less common parts of the existing *ix
implementations which actively contribute to the process.
most of the committees are loath to blue-sky, solicit
proposals/research, or pick an uncommon or unsponsored
implementation, even when manifestly superior. (IMHO,
this is why POSIX is *ix and not, e.g., Plan9 or Inferno.)

OTOH, considering the motivating force behind the process,
it can be argued the above "weakness" is a strength ....

| (why? Because in the real world, you can't. Somethings just suck)

yep. which is not to say POSIX "sucks" per se. but the old
pre-POSIX *ix world arguably did, at least in terms of ease
of software porting. one of *ix's claims to fame is it is
perhaps the first system where one could seriously consider
porting, more or less intact and with relative ease, software
from one architecture+platform+vendor to a radically utterly
different triple.

however, as people discovered, there's a lot of difference
between "consider porting" and "actually porting" --- and
some problems were silly. some were self-inflicted (e.g.,
assuming byte-orientation or a particular endianness); but
others were Frustrating "system" incompatibilities --- the
motivating force that lead to /usr/group, XPG (X/Open), POSIX,
Spec1170, Unix98, Common Unix, &tc.

choose from.» -- commonly attributed to bwk.

| From: Stephen Shirley
|[ ... ]
| It's very easy to get one program to act on the output of a second
| program: cmd1 | cmd2. But, what if you want cmd1 to act on the output
| of cmd2 as well? Hmm. Eventually, I came up with this solution:
|
| mkfifo io
| cmd1 io
|
| and bingo, all was well with the world. Now, I have (and had) a sneaking
| suspcion that it might be possible to do this without using a fifo, and
| can be done using something like:
|
1| exec 3>&1
2| cmd1 &3
3| exec 3>&-
|
| but that doesn't work in that form, and i couldn't work out an
| incantation that would. Anyone got any suggestions? [ ... ]

the above, or something close to it, would work if, when the
1st line is executed, file descriptor (fdesc) 1 is open for both
read and write (R/W) to a suitable entity (e.g., a pipe/FIFO; I
imagine a socket or something of that ilk could be made to work
but have no idea why you'd want to go to the trouble.... ).

but in any case, all that is unlikely to be the case:
· most probably, fdesc 1 is yer tty (e.g. screen + keyboard);
and
· quite possibly is open only for write (being stdout).

you need it open for R/W because all dup2(2) --- which is all
`n>&m' means -- does is replicate the fdesc handle. it does not
change the access mode; e.g., if the original fdesc (m) was only
open for writing (W), that's all the new fdesc (n) is open for.
yet in the 2nd line, it's needed for both R (cmd1) and W (cmd2).

whilst it's impossible to say for certain from this excerpt, it
seems a reasonable guess that fdesc 1 when the 1st line executes
is the stdout of the script itself, which is most probably yer
tty. that means, if it does happen to be open for R/W (which is
the case on some systems), `cmd2' would be writing to the screen
whilst `cmd1' is reading from the keyboard --- i.e., the poor
confused human luser is "clearly" expected to manually echo back
to the computer what it prints.

good luck! ;-)

upshot: the FIFO is needed. and this isn't a shell scripting
problem per se.

the FIFO solution is fine. I've used variations (plural) on
this approach to extend the Korn (ksh(1)) shell language, by
providing a co-processing interpreter --- `ksh' sends certain
predefined commands to the co-process, handling control over
to the co-process until it indicates processing is complete
and `ksh' can resume normal processing. with some thought and
care to insure signals do something rational, works great for
adding a scripting language (which is the purpose) cheaply to
script-less programs (useful when you can't modify the, IMHO,
buggy program to use, e.g., TCL).

cheers!

For the francophones among you, this article is a summary of the
reasons why most free software licences (and the GPL in
particular) are not valid in France.

http://www.linuxfrench.net/article.php3?id_article=1043

Google translation (hard to read most of the time, but good
enough to pick up the gist)

http://makeashorterlink.com/?U26B52602

In brief, in an international contract, when mentioning copyright, you
must mention under which jurisdiction's laws the copyright
is applied. French law requires the licence to be available in
French (the GPL isn't). And French law requires that for a
contract to be valid, it must not breach existing law. Also under
French law, the copyright holder automatically retains the right
to change the licence, which means that French law is in conflict
with the GPL, which requires authorisation from all authors
before a licence change is allowed.

Also there's some stuff about French consumer law forbidding sale
without guarantee of anything, so software delivered as-is
breaches consumer law in France. But I didn't really follow that.

My French is a bit iffy these days, but if this is true, does it not also
nullify Microsoft, Adobe and WinZip licences amongst most others? These all
claim no liability, no guarantees (M$ say delivered "with all faults", so
at least they are honest).

Hi Kevin,

In the past when administering large domains, I've used the DNSTool -
http://www.gormand.com.au/tools/dnstool/guide.html

One custom change I made to this tool was to modify it so that it used a
combination of OpenSSH and sudo for remote commands, file transfers, etc.

This may, or may not be what you're after - I'm presuming that you're
considering writing a tool to do the maintenance of the domains?

Regards,
Andrew

This email is my own opinion, no-one elses, yada yada...

i recently received this email from a friend of mine in the states:

i'm trying to figure out how to maintain about 200 domains, with a
hundred or so computers per domain. some internal, some external.
i recently learned lex and yacc and i'm thinking that's the way to go.
i don't really know perl and i know it's useful but i think i can
write c faster then perl.

is this a good idea?

ps we're really busy.

obviously as a stupid developer with no real admin experience to speak
of, i'm not qualified to answer this question. does anyone with real
admin experience have any suggestions here? the problem sounds really
hard, and i doubt anyone has had to deal with this level of complexity
so there probably aren't any existing tools written.

anyone else have any opinions or experience i could pass on?

Is there a way to get my read email downloaded off webmail.eircom.net.

I've been reading the emails using the web based interface. But I've
reached my quota limit. There doesn't seem to be any way to get the
emails off the server. I can connect to the account using POP, but that
only retrieves unread emails. There's also no way to mark emails as
unread from the html interface.

Is there a way I can use fetchmail perhaps to get it to pull down all
the emails and remove them off the server.

It's been years since I've used fetchmail, I don't recall be able to do
this.

Any other suggestions welcome. There's a few hundred email so I don't
fancy going through each one forwarding it to another account.

I've got some really interesting wav files here.

A friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .

Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and
BBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!

Of course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this collection!

I had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don't do Windows, and the
albums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it's own wav file, 25
Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive.

Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to
attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it doesn't
crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them
completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!

xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does not
have any position control so you just have to listen to the album from start
to finish.

file has this to say about them:

johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV
beatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM,
stereo 22050 Hz
johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ ls -l beatles/SGT.WAV
-r-xr-xr-x 1 johngay johngay 53334900 Sep 27 2001 beatles/SGT.WAV

And this is SGT Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good,
considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in stereo.

What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for
xmms. I'm jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange
compressed wav's that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but
would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums
and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV
plugin, but it does not recognise these either.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Cheers,

John Gay

be honest, is best appreciated if you have access to a HP DesignJet or

Speaking of HP Designjets, has anyone managed to utilise the full width of
the paper on a HP Designjet 750c under RH7.x? The HP can take a 24" wide
roll while the driver (dnj650c) lists a paper size of 16x24.
Unfortunately, this will print only in protrait mode so I get a 24"x24"
page with an unused 8" strip down one side! I'd like to be able to print
24x or whatever (even 24x30!) but I don't seem able to do so.

Any thoughts?

Why we're changing our publishing schedule

Dear Reader,

As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday

Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines. I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.

Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.

Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.

For now, the new schedule is being called a "test," which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works.

I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.

Sincerely,

David Coursey
Executive Editor
AnchorDesk

I CVS'ed the unseen/Sequences changes and installed them, and have only one
real issue.

I use the unseen window rather than the exmh icon, and with the new code
I can't seem to be able to. How many unseen when when I have the main window open
is not really necessary.

hmmm, I stole the code from unseenwin, but I never tested it since I don't use
that functionality. Consider it on my list of things to check.

It seems to only support PPPoA and not PPPoE. You need one that supports
PPPoE, if you want torun it in routed IP mode. If you are using it as a
bridge, it'll probably work, but you'd be left leaving the computer on,
which would defeat the purpose of getting a router.

The best router I've come accross is the Zyxel 643. Eircom supply this,
but if you have alook online you can probably find it cheaper to buy
online from America or the UK.

Hope this is useful,

| From: "Matthew French"
|[ ... ]
| Now here is a thought: a Unix version of the "Deleted Items" folder.
|
| In the root of a hard drive, create a directory ".unwanted".
| Then periodically create hard links to every file on the hard
| drive that does not have hard links.
|
| That way, when someone accidentally does "rm *" or whatever,
| you still have a link under ".unwanted" [ ... ]

hum. interesting variation on the classic technique of
redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations
are endless). these classic techniques only provide a
means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
hard link idea.

but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
back of accidental overwrites.

( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the "snapshot"
facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers. and of the
various "versioning" filesystems which appeared --- and
then vanished? --- over the years.... )

one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
hard links. both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*
files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets
complain if there are hard links.

Mornin' all,
Last night, i was involved in an epic struggle to write a shell
script to do a certain task. The battle raged for hours, but, i'm glad
to inform you, i emerged victorious. The problem was as follows:
It's very easy to get one program to act on the output of a second
program: cmd1 | cmd2. But, what if you want cmd1 to act on the output of
cmd2 as well? Hmm. Eventually, I came up with this solution:

mkfifo io
cmd1 io

and bingo, all was well with the world. Now, I have (and had) a sneaking
suspcion that it might be possible to do this without using a fifo, and
can be done using something like:

exec 3>&1
cmd1 &3
exec 3>&-

but that doesn't work in that form, and i couldn't work out an
incantation that would. Anyone got any suggestions? Anyway, victory is
mine, and i is happy person once again. In case you were wondering, the
aim of all of this was to write a shell script that could check for new
mail on an imap server.

My French is a bit iffy these days, but if this is true, does it not also
nullify Microsoft, Adobe and WinZip licences amongst most others? These all
claim no liability, no guarantees (M$ say delivered "with all faults", so
at least they are honest).

Apparently the angle on this (i.e. selling without guarantee) is that
software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at
least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing
no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed, you could
always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

or trying to
hire talented people,
the full-featured career resource center is the place to start. Find your
IT talent solution

I've got a few quick Lockergnome-related notes for you today.

First, we'd really like to see you in August. I know that Jake, Chris and Randy have been signing off on their newsletters with those few words, and I'll join them. If you didn't experience Gnomedex last year, you missed, in the words of many industry insiders, "The show of the year." It was unlike any other computer conference I've ever attended. Unlike any conference I've attended, period, computer-related or not. While most such conferences are a huge hustle and hassle, Gnomedex was what computing and Lockergnome are all about - sharing useful information, gathering with like-minded enthusiasts, and learning to use your chosen computer to the fullest extent. No hustle. No hassle. No BS. For the minimal cost of registration, it would be hard to find a better weekend for geeks and wannabes alike. Add to that the schedule of luminaries presenting and attending and you've got the best deal on the planet for computer users. It's hard to believe we're less than a month away - I really do hope to see you there.

Another Lockergnome innovation has hit the newsstands - err, bookstores. That's right. Jake has release a FREE GnomeTome on "Converting Vinyl LPs to CD." Who'd have thought there were so many of you out there that are, well, my age and still in possession of those black slabs of aural heaven. I don't know if Jake's just lost his mind, or what, but free? Get outta here. Go ahead - "Gnome" our servers. Get you copy while you can. And while you're there, check out some of the other killer e-tip books in the GnomeTomes collection.

Have a great Tuesday.

Setting the Home Page in Konqueror

Konqueror, while a great browser, has taken a step in the direction of IE. Like IE, Konqueror is really an integrated web and file browser. You can use it equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been something of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a browser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question - it's a web browser and a web broswer only.

Regardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror browser and end up in your /home/user directory. Have no fear, though. It's an easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror.

Open Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select "Configure Konqueror," and leave the default selection of "File Manager" as is. In the text box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the "Home URL" text box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the home URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home page. Select OK to close the window.

Taking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser to open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select "Window" and "Save View Profile, 'Web Browsing.'" This will futher save the URL and allow your the opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens.

Konqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it act like a pure web browser if you just know where to look.

Kernel Configuration - Part XII

Depending on who you talk to, RAID can stand for "Redundant Array of Independent Discs" or "Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs." No matter. They both point to the same theory and practice in Linux; data storage redundancy. That's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support.

Let's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple discs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally, there are 5 levels of RAID in Linux; Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and RAID-5.

Linear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In other words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no redundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further, there's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one drive in the RAID array at a time.

RAID-0 "stripes" data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the first drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no redundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives, not all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0 will, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly.

RAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0, does provide data redundancy. This is the first level in which data is "mirrored" across the drives in the RAID array. All data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at least two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall RAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can actually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is written across multiple discs.

RAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for parity information while striping the data across the others. This is much like Linear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data can be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but this really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is probably the least used of the RAID schemes.

RAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed. Like RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than reserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the array. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can be accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a "spare disc" configuration will allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after the failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5 is probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices.

With all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel configuration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to configure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel configuration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the RAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate option.

Tomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.

Windows Apps in Linux?
Scribbled by Robert Nix

"Nice coverage but I don't give a flip about Office. OpenOffice is fine
for my needs.

"What I really want is to run Quicken (at least v.2001) which is the only
app keeping me running Windows (using vmware). I've tried Quicken on Mac
OS X and it is grossly inadequate and on Linux with Wine and have so far
been unsuccessful even using tips from
http://appdb.codeweavers.com/appview.php?appId=107. I hope that GnuCash
will eventually support the online features I enjoy but that doesn't
help now.

"The reason I'm writing this is that I personally think Office products
are overrated for home users, at least now that there are several native
alternatives. For home users, finance apps are the key issue now. Do a
section on getting Quicken to run in Wine and I'll declare you a god. :)"

Important Unix Manpages

http://home.ins.de/~m.hussmann/man/

Manpages are an important part of Linux use. Armed with the proper knowledge and manpage, there are few sticky situations in Linux that can't be solved quickly. Though they can be a bit cryptic at times, manpages are really a Linux newbie's best friend.

Important Unix Manpages is a compilation of help for situations that actually have little to do with programming. They're more human interface problems than machine interface problems. This page just points out that if life was like Linux, we'd all be a lot happier.

having great fun trying to find a dumb ADSL modem with Ethernet
presentation, everybody wants to sell routers but I intend on doing pppoe
from another device, something with more than one Ethernet port would be
nice.
anybody got any recommendations ?

It seems to only support PPPoA and not PPPoE. You need one that supports
PPPoE, if you want torun it in routed IP mode. If you are using it as a
bridge, it'll probably work, but you'd be left leaving the computer on,
which would defeat the purpose of getting a router.

The best router I've come accross is the Zyxel 643. Eircom supply this,
but if you have alook online you can probably find it cheaper to buy
online from America or the UK.

Hope this is useful,
Joe

Quoting Ronan Waide :

Sure, but soft links would do the same. To be honest, I'm trying to
think of a useful use of hard links right now, and I'm a little
stumped. There's gotta be some benefit that I'm missing that's
immediately obvious to everyone.

Using Niall's example - single set of files but >1 namespace, and suppose that
you want to delete some items from the set according to rules applied to the
namespaces. With soft links you need an *extra* namespace the others refer to,
and after filtering the namespaces, you have to do a manual reference count to
decide what goes and what stays. With hard links, you just unlink and deletion
is automatic.

Couldn't have put it better myself, but that's not going to stop me trying :-)
The above situation occurs precisely because of the major functional difference
between symbolic links (AKA soft links, or symlinks to their friends) and hard
links. Two hard links to the same file are exactly equivalent - one is no more
the files "real" directory entry than is the other. OTOH a symlink is a special
thing which is a link to a real file, and when the file linked to is erased, you
end up with a broken symbolic link - you can't have a broken hard link (except
of course in the case of a banjaxed filesystem).

I don't go to many concerts, but that doesn't mean I don't
appreciate listening to good
music at every waking moment. Tonight, a handful of Bay
Gnomies and I watched They Might Be Giants rock the Fillmore.
Melanie, Steve, Brent, Missy, Robert, Patrick, Gretchen, Matt, and
Mindy had a total blast. Well, it wasn't much fun when Robert got
his digital camera confiscated - but this was a show worthy of
five megapixels
(believe me)! Brent went to
the show last night, and I saw them play on the set earlier this
afternoon. They were selling a new CD (which had JUST been
released the other day); "They Got Lost" is full of a few
previously-unavailable tracks. If you aren't sure about purchasing
it outright, I strongly urge you to sign up for a trial EMusic account and download
a few of their songs in MP3 format. Oh, and check out the opening
act: Noe Venable. She's got
a few free MP3s on
her site, too. Give "Boots" a shot - very nice.

Does anybody know how to set a binary clock? Melanie got it for me
as a gift (which was a very nice gesture). Sure, I could read the
manual - but the ones and zeros start to look eerily similar after
flipping past the first page. You know me: I'm not much of a math
guy. In fact, I just discovered the other day that 'byte' was
short for 'by eight' (even though I already knew that 'bit'
represented 'binary digit'). I'd stick with a digital timepiece,
but it just isn't geeky enough for me anymore. How sad is that?
I'm ready to walk on the wild side. Maybe I'll get my laptop
pierced tomorrow? It could happen. I've been known to do nutty
things on a moment's notice, like changing my default Web browser.
Courtesy of Asa
Dotzler, I have an official Mozilla sticker, CD, and t-shirt
(which you saw me model in my Webcam the other day). Don't be too
jealous; Mozilla.org has
plenty of goodies to go around.

Looks as though Jake
and Lori are already having a blast in St. Louis.
They're at the Shareware Industry Conference, along with hundreds
of well-known program programmers - the people who make our
computers work the way we want them to work! We're doing our best
to convince them to join us at Gnomedex. They ask: "Who else
is going to be there?" We answer: "People who don't know you yet."
They ask: "Then why should I come?" We answer: "Because it's a
business opportunity for you." They ask: "What if I don't want to
learn anything or meet anybody?" We answer: "We can't really help
you there, but here - have lunch on us." They ask: "Oh, the

GigAlarm v1.201 [33k] W9x/2k/XP FREE

http://users.bigpond.net.au/glina/GigAlarm.htm

{String on your finger} Sometimes, I'm a bit like the absent-minded professor... I would forget my own head if it wasn't attached. So naturally, I appreciate any program that can help keep me on track, and with GigAlarm I can setup whatever reminders/alarms I need. However, sometimes a simple text message just won't catch my attention. Well, herein lies the beauty of GigAlarm... it doesn't just have to give you a text alarm! GigAlarm can play a WAV file (random, or your selection), change your background, start a program, or use one of the many Windows shutdown options. My wife has gotten in the habit of using the Shutdown option as an alarm to signal that I have spent too long on the computer. (Lucky for me, there is a snooze button!) NOTE: The author says, "This program is essentially free to use for non-profit purposes... If you find this program useful I would appreciate $10 AUD (or $5 USD) as a token of your appreciation."

Context Thumbview v1.0.b1 [107k] W9x/2K/XP FREE

http://contextmagic.netfirms.com/image-viewer/

{Peep show} I'm not always very patient, especially when it comes to my computer. Double-clicking on an image and waiting for it to come up in my image viewer is almost too much for me to handle. Lucky for me, Context Thumbview has made its way onto my system and I no longer have to wait to view an image. All I do now is right-click the image, choose "View Thumbnail," and there is the image, out there for me to see... all without me having to open up any programs! "As Express ThumbView is an Explorer extension, it is always ready and available for use. Moreover, it is available in any Explorer window, including Open and Save As... dialog boxes." As an added bonus, with Context Thumbview installed on my system, I can also turn off the thumbnail view if I want to save system resources.

Starter v5.5.4.2175 [423k] W9x/2k/XP FREE

http://codestuff.tripod.com/

{Startup manager} This application bills itself as "Yet Another Startup Manager"... I don't think so! Starter isn't JUST another Startup Manager, it's a piece of programming art. One of my biggest problems with Windows Task Manager is that I don't know what all the processes on my machine are, or from where they are running. Starter not only gives me that information, but it also lets me save it as an HTML file. In addition, Starter lets me import and export registry keys or add a new task to be processed. Don't run all over your machine trying to find all the programs you need to control your PC, when you can do it all (and more!) with Starter.

Aversoft Sticker v3.55 [592k] W9x/2k/XP US$15
Unearthed by Sergei Lepyokhin

http://www.aversoft.com/sticker/

{Sticky notes} Did you know that Post-it(r) Notes were invented by accident? I use to have these notes all over my monitor. Now my screen is clean as a whistle! Aversoft Sticker is a program to help you remember "important information by displaying skinnable sticky notes on your Windows desktop." No more bland notes for me! With Sticker, I am surrounded with pictures of paradise (downloaded from Aversoft's website). These great features are no accident. Sticker also has a transparency feature that makes the notes only half visible, making it much easier to use while working on your other programs. Don't walk away yet though... Sticker also allows you to print your notes, lock them from accidentally being deleted, and set an alarm (repeating or one-time). Speaking of alarms, mine just went off and opened up Outlook. Time to send out today's newsletter!

GnomeTIP

Gnomies are known for their willingness to help others and Alex Warren is no exception with a tip on copying text. Alex writes: "Did you know that you can copy the contents of a message/dialog box just by pressing Ctrl+C?" Alex also had this to say: "When you select text and then use the mouse to drag it to a new location, the original text moves to the new location and disappears from the old location. However, you can select text and then use the right mouse button to drag it to a new location. When you do this, releasing the right mouse button opens a menu from which you can choose to move or copy the text (along with several other options)." Those are some great time saving tips Alex! Following suit with using Ctrl + C to copy... you can also use Ctrl + X to cut and Ctrl + V to paste. You can also use all these tips on more then just text! The next time you need to copy some files on your PC, try the right-click and drag method and you will see what I mean... along with saving yourself some time.

I got the DSL-W 906E from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk.

Though it's not at all the best one around I have to say it does the job
and a bit. Some of the features can be a pain to get working (ie. pptp in
pppoe mode - can't figure it out). The documentation is not the best, but
the guys from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk will help you ouit. They
also have a message board.

The command line interface is quite powerful, but absolutely not
userfriendly.

All in all it's a cheap desent performer, that I am happy enough with.
Got this one including a microfilter (not needed) for 140euro including
shipping. Better than any deal from Eircom.

I thought I baked my Dell PowerEdge 1400SC server yesterday
when it refused to boot completely. I borrowed a data vac
from a friend and decided to clean all of the dust and cat
hair from my systems, then after reconnecting everything,
the server would boot to the initial splash screen, where
there is a POST progress bar, but would not proceed past
past about the first 1/5th of the bar. Uh-oh. What did I
fry?

As it turns out, it was another case of "always check the
small stuff". Oh, I had all of the cables plugged back in to
the server properly, I checked all of that, but it didn't
dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later that
I should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the
cables. That server is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM
switch and with all of the yanking, plucking and shuffling,
the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the switch just a
tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning
message like every other computer on the planet, I can only
attribute to the BIOS developers. Server Satchel, running
Red Hat Linux 7.2 is now operating as it was previously. The
penguin is happy. The server case is even black. How
appropriate...

ATI Still Makes Video Cards?

Say it isn't so! Yes, apparently they do still have
something to say about NVIDIA's dominance in the video card
market. Seeing as how they've been all but dumped by the
majority of top-tier system makers, it's hard to believe
that they are capable of a serious comeback. Judging from
what AnandTech has to say about the forthcoming R300-based
cards, it appears that they haven't thrown in the towel just
yet. I'm all for competition, so I welcome the effective re-
entrance into the high end market. Let's all hope that their
driver development has improved as much as their hardware
seems to have.

Technical Censorship

http://news.com.com/2100-1023-944315.html

Odd. I liked that cup of Mocha (spelled M-O-C-H-A and I'll explain in a minute) I drank at Starbucks when Jake and I visited last week, but if I wanted to relay that to someone using a Yahoo email account, you might see an alternate word. Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of you using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and the word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in drinks. They've also had a terrible time interpretting our W3C standardized HTML lately, dropping in copious #message references throughout the text in their new Beta email client. So why the text replacement? It's another filtering technique to stop certain words that might relate to JavaScript functions. I guess I'll have to choose another beverage next time. Silly me.

Yer Kidding... Really?

http://www.theregus.com/content/4/25629.html

I'm all sorts of sarcastic today, aren't I? Those of us
that have had to manage budgets are used to dealing with
math in terms of hardware, software, maintenance and
personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's
certainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of
Linux on a server with less hardware requirements just to do
some file sharing, printing and maybe an Intranet page or
three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very long last,
Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to
point out that they have much more to offer than Linux,
which may indeed be true. But at the end of the day, when
you compare donuts to donuts and like functions against one
another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained
staff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge,
requiring additional training, suffer the odd blunder here
and there, and be less forgiving when it comes to detailed
configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use
Windows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a
replacement. Cheap is in the budget of the beholder.

Quoting Ronan Waide :

Sure, but soft links would do the same. To be honest, I'm trying to
think of a useful use of hard links right now, and I'm a little
stumped. There's gotta be some benefit that I'm missing that's
immediately obvious to everyone.

No there doesn't :-) . The Bell labs Unix people implemented hard
links, whereas Bill Joy and co. at Berkeley implemented soft links,
five years later, mainly to get around not being able to do
cross-device hard linking, as I understand it. Soft links are fairly
classic Berkeley hackery (cf. gethostbyname, h_errno, and the
resultant problems implementing mt-safe interfaces); they do what they
were intended for, but break fairly easily, in this case when the
target file was deleted. For a better design for similar ideas, see
the MacOS.

Adios to options excess?
If the nation's politicians expect Silicon Valley to fall in line on the issue of expensing stock options, they're living in a fantasy world.

Flipping through my Rolodex this past week, I couldn't find one solitary technology type willing to support even the mildest proposal to change how corporations account for stock options. The more common response was a verbal "middle finger" shouted in the general direction of Washington.

No surprises, there. The options argument is not just about putting food on the table--make that a lot of food, in some cases--but about the way the computer industry views itself. Tech companies believe they belong in a different category, say, from the likes of Coca Cola, Washington Post Co. and Bank One Corp.--all which recently decided to begin expensing stock options.

Tech titans also served notice they will remember to support friends--and shun foes--in Washington next November. An empty threat? Perhaps, but consider this: in the last national election, the computer industry contributed more than $40 million (52 percent to Democrats, 46 percent to Republicans.) That was good for a seventh place ranking, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Charlie Cooper, Executive Editor/Commentary

Why the options party is over

Transamerica Investment Management portfolio manager Kenneth Broad says
it's easy to see why the tech industry is fighting so hard to keep options from
being expensed: no one likes to lose a free lunch.

The setup is as follows:
I develop a piece of code using PHP 3.0.9 which is, to
my knowledge, GPL.

PHP is released under the GPL, yes.

The piece of code runs on my server and is an integral part of a system
that I have developed for a client. I did not recieve payment for this
particular piece of code but I did recieve payment for the system. My client
now wants to use a different service provider but keep my code.

Do I have a right to claim intellectual property rights for my little
piece of code that he did not pay me for or do I have to give the client the
code under the GPL.

Exactly what rights you would have to the code depends on the contractual
arrangement you have with your client, and I'm betting that that's not at
all cut and dried.

However, I have been in this situation where a client was using code I
developed and then decided that he should own the code. Push never came to
shove (at least, not yet :-) ) but my understanding of the situation vis a
vis software is that in the absence of any contract granting ownership of
the code to another party, it remains with the person who wrote it. I didn't
take legal advice on this but my customer did :-) and his lawyer told him
that I was right and would most likely win in court.

So much for the ownership of the code vis a vis you and your client - now for
the GPL issues.

Code compiled by a compiler which is GPL software (e.g. gcc) is not itself
covered by the GPL unless its author chooses to make it so. This is perhaps
not made clear enough in the GPL text and is a particular piece of FUD which
Microsoft loves to toss about. Similarly, the copy of PHP which is part of
your customer's system is covered by the GPL. You can charge him whatever
you like for it but you must provide him with acces to the source code, and
you cannot restrict what he can do with it (in this case, move it to another
service provider). However, you have not (I take it) chosen to license YOUR
code under the GPL so the conditions of the GPL do NOT apply to it.

If OTOH you had written some code which modified PHP as such, and then
distributed (whether for a fee or not) that modified PHP, then the modified
code must be licensed under the GPL. But this applies to a modification to
PHP itself and NOT to your scripts which run under PHP.

The relevant clause is 2(b) which says (though Lord knows why I'm quoting when
locate COPYING will turn up a shedload of copies of the GPL on just about
any Linux box - 540 on this box)

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.

Your PHP scripts do not contain, nor are they derived from, PHP, in whole or
in part.

I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciated

Microsoft has very much made this a Linux issue - it has attempted to imply
that any company using GPL software must make everything it owns public and
it must be true - that nice man from Microsoft wouldn't lie, would he ?

Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to
spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a
good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for organizations that might be in need of such skills. And, I've
seen some very interesting suggestions for names for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the
above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the
subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort
through my email system.

It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users.
According to this article on The Register, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its
previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2
upgrade at $129.

I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how
difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues,
by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early
2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which

were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few

years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain

free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income sources.

On a brighter note, it looks like Mandrake has found a sweet spot. According to their most
recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the
company's
history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put
them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will
only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was
the result of the Mandrake Linux User's
Club.

The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
partnership venture, an agreement with Microtel to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on WalMart.com.
I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine
charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the
addition of both Lindows
and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail
computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.

Have a great Wednesday.

Checking Mail With KMail

I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me from

my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail,
procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong
contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE
desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.

There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't
automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much
time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the
additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an
irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple
configuration issue.

To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in

your KDE panel. Select "Preferences" and the "Execute" tab. In the Execute
window, change the command line to read:

kmail --check -caption "%c" %i %m

The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when
you open the program.

Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?

Kernel Configuration - Part XIII

As you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for
networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to
stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should

come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel
configuration is dense with details and options.

I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of
the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock
configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas.
You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be
used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external).

Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.

For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:

The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo
covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel
configuration issues

Linux Network Security from Linux Planet
a nice tutorial on network security
Network Security with /proc/sys/net/ipv4
other approaches to network security

These should get you started. Tomorrow, we'll cover telephony support in your
Linux kernel.

"PyMP3Cut is a Python commandline tool designed to cut huge (> 100MB) MP3 files
at high speed without requiring the extra disk space and processing time usually

needed by visual audio editing tools, which convert the MP3 format to more
easily manageable formats like WAV before doing anything. It reads and cuts
simultaneously according to the autodetected MP3 frame rate and a timeline

Linux PR

http://linuxpr.com/

If the daily Linux news sites are starting to get you down, maybe it's time for
a change. Linux PR is an up-to-the-minute listing of events and developments in
the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most recent articles in
descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real
downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very
company-oriented - clearly the work of PR firms cranking out press releases.
Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and keeping up on
your favorite OS.

07.09.2002 GnomeREPORT

Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well.
Register for Gnomedex today!

I've finally done it! Lockrgnome's Top 50
Mac OS X Tips is in publication
and available for purchase at GnomeTomes.com. Less than half the tips have
appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means
getting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've
written that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy,
I'll be ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will
find them useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things
on the list has improved my personal OS X experience.

Although this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing
sections of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the
contributions of the other two guys. This does not mean either of them is
truly less involved, it just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and
Randy regularly send me links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which
will ultimately end up in upcoming issues. Since the writing will be
primarily mine, I've opted to eliminate the "Review by" links at the bottom
of each article. Unless otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it.
If you need to send me an e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the
sidebar will reach me, as well as putting your message in front of Chris
and Randy.

I've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months
and believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going
to add a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what
your level of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with
some really basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting
topics. Either way, I'm open to some
AppleScript suggestions.

See You in August, Jake Ludington

Sherlock Plugins v2.2 [600k] Mac OS 9/OSX FREE

http://www.searchstandard.com/

While doing some research for my top 50 tips, I discovered that turning
off some of Sherlock's extras, like multi-language indexing, in the
preferences will speed things up considerably, particularly for local
machine searches. This renewed my interest in finding ways to add-on
search capabilities to the bundled sleuth, resulting in my discovery of
SearchStandard.com. This bundled collection of search plug-ins makes it
possible to look for almost anything using Sherlock. Their Web site
won't wow you, but SearchStandard's free plugins most certainly make
finding things online, including searches on your favorite Mac sites,
that much easier.

Xnet v1.0.6 [216k] OSX $48

http://bitcom.ch/products-xnet-e.html

Dealing with servers that offer mission critical services, like
intranet access, e-mail, or Web serving, means dealing with those
services failing from time to time. Don't be left in the dark
when one of your services go down, let Xnet keep you informed.
The unregistered version of the product lets you verify http,
ping, smtp, and ftp service availability, with many more service
verifications included in the pro version. Xnet runs on your
local machine, verifying remote service availability and sending
you a message when those services go down. The interface allows
for user-defined services, with alert features for both an e-mail
account (mine alerts are going to my cell phone) and locally via
a sound from your machine.

GnomeTERMINAL

For OS X installs with multiple users, there may come a time when you
need to change ownership of a particular file. This is particularly
useful in situations where one user created a file, but an entirely
different user is the only one who will ever make future decisions
relating to that file, like whether to keep it or throw it in the
Trash. chown is the Terminal command designed to handle this. From
the command line type:

sudo chown username filename

You'll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for
username. The name of the file receiving a change of ownership will
replace filename.

Show Info gives you access to change the application associated with a
particular file type, rename files, and reassign permissions. One of
the best features of Show Info is it's ability to store "comments"
related to a file or application. This can be a great place to store
information on recently made changes to a file, information from others
who've looked at a file, or in the case of applications, serial numbers
and other pertinent data you may need when dealing with tech support.

I have been trying to research via SA mirrors and search engines if a canned
script exists giving clients access to their user_prefs options via a
web-based CGI interface. Numerous ISPs provide this feature to clients, but
so far I can find nothing. Our configuration uses Amavis-Postfix and ClamAV
for virus filtering and Procmail with SpamAssassin for spam filtering. I
would prefer not to have to write a script myself, but will appreciate any
suggestions.

That always amazes me about 'regular' dreams - how often they come true.

In 1993 or so, when I was a student in Edinburgh, I had a bad dream about
being chased around a house by a scary murderous tramp who was carrying a
bag full of half-penny coins (which had long since ceased to be legal
tender). The next morning as I left the flat, I found a half-penny on the
doormat right outside our door. Fair gave me the willies, that did.

why?

or more specifically, what do you mean? on one hand you can optimise
how gcc is compiled. all that will do is make it generate the exact
same code just a smidge faster. and since gcc is such a memory pig,
you'd do better to buy more ram to up your fs cache hits and to keep
gcc's heap out of swap.

on the other side you can look into patches to gcc that affect it's
code generation. um, ok, but keep in mind that compiler errors suck.
i can't express that enough. compilers should just work. perfectly.
always. doing anything that might affect that is, in my opinion, insane.
they're hard to trace and you'd better have a deep knowledge of what's
going on to either report bugs to the patch developers or to fix it
yourself. plus my understanding is that gcc would need major changes
to get large speed boosts on x86 chips.

On the surface, it seems odd that Microsoft and AOL compete with
one another. After all, while Microsoft is a giant software
powerhouse, AOL Time Warner is totally different--a giant media
powerhouse. Nonetheless, they're at it again, working like crazy
to dominate the ISP space. While AOL is busy renovating the guts
of upcoming AOL 8.0, which will finally integrate the Netscape
browser, Microsoft is nipping at its competition's heels with MSN
8.0. Will Microsoft make enough improvements to finally catch up
with AOL? It just might. Find out more in our MSN 8.0 First
Take.

First Take: MSN 8.0 Beta

Redmond has been talking up the newest version of MSN for months,
and now, the proof"s in the pudding. Testers have their hands on
the beta of MSN 8.0, and so far, this ISP looks and works better
than past versions. The great No. 8 even has antispam tools and
improved parental controls. But will MSN topple AOL?

First Take: ICQ Lite Alpha

One of our biggest beefs with ICQ has always been its bloated
feature set. Now, the company has released a new lite ICQ that
sucks up far less system memory than the full-fat version--but at
what cost? We take an early look.

gcc, glibc and binutils, which the lfs site says not to optimise,
already determines what system you're compiling on, and optimises itself
to that. That's my understanding of how it works anyway.

why?

or more specifically, what do you mean? on one hand you can optimise
how gcc is compiled. all that will do is make it generate the exact
same code just a smidge faster. and since gcc is such a memory pig,
you'd do better to buy more ram to up your fs cache hits and to keep
gcc's heap out of swap.

on the other side you can look into patches to gcc that affect it's code
generation. um, ok, but keep in mind that compiler errors suck. i can't
express that enough. compilers should just work. perfectly. always.
doing anything that might affect that is, in my opinion, insane. they're
hard to trace and you'd better have a deep knowledge of what's going on
to either report bugs to the patch developers or to fix it yourself.
plus my understanding is that gcc would need major changes to get large
speed boosts on x86 chips.

Readers mourn Gene Kan

Peer-to-peer pioneer dies, Macworld kicks off in Manhattan, and
the PayPal/eBay merger is not going so well.

--Laura Lindhe, executive editor, CNET Tech Trends

1

Gene Kan:

Gnutella open-source guru Gene Kan, who died on June
29 in an apparent suicide, was clearly beloved by the CNET
community. Last week, search requests for information on
25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on
products and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the
peer-to-peer space, many credit him with legitimizing file
sharing--making it about more than music, according to Wired
News.

2

Macworld:

The annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a
good show, whether or not Steve Jobs has anything real to
announce. So far, it looks like Apple has already surprised a
few by announcing the release of QuickTime 6.0 (see No. 7),
which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing
quagmire.

3

PayPal:

It's been a rocky road thus far for the eBay and
PayPal deal. Soon after eBay announced it was buying PayPal
for $1.5 billion, shareholders filed a lawsuit claiming that
PayPal's price tag was too low. This week, PayPal is being
subpoenaed by the New York attorney general in regard to its
involvement with online gambling transactions.

4

Wi-Fi:

I'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up
on the Buzz Meter permanently. This time, Wi-Fi is getting
interest because of a possible pact between tech heavyweights,
including Intel, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon Communications, to
build wireless access places across the nation in public areas
where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as
airports.

5

eMac:

This is the for-education-only computer that consumers
wanted so badly that Apple released it to them. The CNET
review is out, and here's the word: the eMac is what the iMac
used to be. Basically, it's an easy-to-use, fairly inexpensive
computer for users who don't need to do much besides word
processing and accessing the Web.

Using Razor2 via SpamAssasin.

System is Solaris 2.7, with qmail. Spamassassin run via user's procmail.
All users who use SA have run razor-register.

Razor2 is failing, and I can't find anything in the limited docs or on
google on it,
and I'm hoping someone can help.

The error (which doesn't prevent SA from working) is:

sort of. Squid, and most other good http proxies won't let you connect
to any other destination port other than 443 (by default). So the sshd
has to be listening on port 443. PuTTy's proxy support is a bit flaky
right now, the raw connects are a bit flaky aswell, I can't get them
to work with certain revisions of IOS becuase they use different prompts
and success strings, gah! I havnt played with the SOCKS proxy support
much yet, but it's there.

If you're trying to SSH through a http proxy, use netcat :)
PuTTy's proxy stuff will take another few weeks to get stable, and
currently it won't send keepalives, so if you go afk expect your
session to get killed by the proxy. Netcat send keepalives
which prevent this :)

}

course that assumes you have bash, I use cygwin, but the above should be
doable natively, then again if you have cygwin, use OpenSSH and it's
excellently configurable proxycmd :)

All you car about are the confs as the boite has no DATA right?

Yeah, but then I'd have to remember _exactly_ which confs I'd modified and
they're not all in /etc either...

Thats what I would do, but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult &
complicated as possible ;--)

Yup... In this case, I had two issues. 1. I mirrored the disk to give to
someone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2
processor. 2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I
wanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware
related. Again, it's also an interesting exercise...

Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious
hassle down the line.

Oh, I'm doing that too. This is going to Africa so I'm aiming for as
robust as possible with belt, braces and probably an all-in-one jumpsuit!
I'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning
strike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise) I'm also going for a
backup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org . The
admin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got
fried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible
install will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...

EDITOR'S CORNER

How to Publish Your Windows XP FTP Server to the Internet
Several of you wrote in about last week's article on installing an FTP Server. You said "that was great, but you only told half the story". You wanted to know two more things:

How to make the FTP Server available to Internet users
How to secure the FTP Server

There are several ways to make an FTP server on the internal network available to users on the Internet. These methods are referred to as "Server Publishing". You can use a Windows XP computer running Internet Connection Services (ICS) to publish a server on your internal network.

Let's take a look at a common scenario. You have a Windows XP computer connected to the Internet with an always-on cable or DSL connection. You have another computer on your private network also running Windows XP. You've installed the FTP Server on this internal network computer and put files into the FTP folder. Now you want Internet users to connect to the FTP Server through the ICS computer directly connected to the Internet.

You can do this with the Windows XP ICS! Here's how:

Go into the Network Connections window. You can get there from the Network applet in the Control Panel.
Right click the network interface directly connected to the Internet and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab in the connection's Properties dialog box. Put a checkmark in the Internet Connection Firewall checkbox. Always make sure the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled when you connect a computer directly to the Internet.
Click the Settings button, then click on the Services tab in the Advanced Settings dialog box.
Now click the Add button. This brings up the Service Settings dialog box. Type in My FTP Server in the Description of service text box. In the Name or IP address text box, type in the IP address of the computer on your private network that's running the FTP server. Since you're using ICS, it'll have an IP address like 192.168.0.x, where x is different for each machine on your network. You might want to manually assign the IP address the FTP Server already has, so that it doesn't change in the future. You can find out what IP address your FTP server is using by opening a command prompt at the FTP server and typing in the command ipconfig. That will give you the IP address the FTP Server is using. Back to the Service Settings dialog box, select the TCP option button. For the External Port and the Internet port, put in the port number you assigned to the FTP server on your internal network. Read this week's How To section to see how to change the listening port number. Clic!
k OK
Click OK, and then click OK one more time! You might need to disable and enable the adapter after making the change. You can do that by right clicking the always-on interface.

The procedure is very similar for dial-up connections. However, there are problems with dial-up connections (and many always-on connections) because the IP address on the external interface of the ICS computer changes over time. Next week I'll share with you a cool way you can get around this problem by using something called a "dynamic DNS service". I've used one for years, and it works great. Make sure to tune in next week for the details.

There you have it. Is server publishing in your future? Have any questions on the method I described above? If so, let me know! There are lots of ways you can publish services. Tell me how you do it, and tricks you've learned along the way. If you're having problems with server publishing, let me know about those too! I'll be sure to include what I learn from you in upcoming newsletters.

Until next week,
Tom Shinder, Editor
(email us with feedback: feedback@winxpnews.com)

HINTS, TIPS, TRICKS & TWEAKS

Allow Dial-up Connections to Synchronize Time with Internet Time Servers
Do you use a dial-up connection but can't get your machine to synchronize its clock with an Internet time server when the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled? If so, here's a tip Richard Surry sent in on how to fix the problem:

Open your Network Connections window from the start menu.
Right click on your modem (or other dial-up connection) and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab. You already have a checkmark in the box that enables the ICF. Click on the Settings button.
Click on the Services tab, then click on the Add button in the Services tab.
That should open the Service Settings dialog box. In the Description box, put in Internet Time Service. For the Name or IP address of the computer hosting this service on your network, type in 127.0.0.1. Select the TCP protocol option button. For both the external and internal port numbers, type 123.
If you're online, disconnect and reconnect. Now synchronize the time by double click on the clock in the system tray and going to the Internet Time tab.

This is an interesting tip, and it represents an even more interesting problem. For you network geeks out there, I'll ask you this question: Why should we allow unsolicited inbound connections for the Internet Time Service? The ICF should not block responses to solicited outbound connections, so why should we have to enable reverse NAT to make this work?

HOW TO'S: ALL THE NEW XP FEATURES

How to Secure an FTP Server on Windows XP Professional
Last week we went over how to install the Windows XP FTP Server. It will work fine after going through the steps outlined last week, but several of you asked for more information on how to secure the FTP Server because you wanted to connect it to the Internet. It's a very good idea to understand how FTP security works before putting the server on the Internet. Here are some suggestions:

Open the Internet Information Services console from the Administrative Tools menu. In the left pane of the console, expand your server name and then expand the FTP Sites node.
Right click on the Default FTP Site and click the Properties command.
Click on the FTP Site tab. Notice that the default TCP Port is set to 21. This is the well-known port for FTP. You can increase security a bit by changing this port to another value that's in the 1026-65534 range. This secures it from poorly motivated click-kiddies and also allows you to get around your ISP blocking incoming connections to TCP port 21. Friends who connect to your FTP server will need to change the port number on their FTP client software as well.
The Windows XP FTP server has a hard coded limit of 10 simultaneous connections. You might want to change this to a lower number to reduce the chance of a LAN party on the external interface of the FTP server.
Put a checkmark in the Enable Logging checkbox. Click the Properties button to the right of the log format drop-down list box. Click the Daily option button on the General Properties tab. On the Extended Properties tab, select all of the Extended Properties. Click OK.
Click on the Security Accounts tab. Place a checkmark in the Allow only anonymous connections checkbox. This prevents users from sending username and password credentials to the FTP server. You don't want users to send credentials because those credentials are sent in "clear text", which can be read by anyone who's listening on the wire.
Click the Messages tab. Enter a Welcome message, an Exit message, and a message users will see if there are no available connections.
Click on the Home Directory tab. Make sure there is a checkmark in the Read and Log Visits checkboxes. REMOVE the checkmark in the Write checkbox. Note the location in the Local Path text box. Navigate to that path in the Windows Explorer.
Right click on the FTPROOT folder and click Properties.
Click on the Security tab. Make sure that SYSTEM has Full Control. Assign the IUSR_ account READ access only. Remove all other permissions for the IUSR account. Make sure you give Adminstrators Full Control tool. This allows you, the administrator on the FTP Server computer, to add, remove and change files in the FTPROOT folder.

Stop and restart the FTP Server. Now your FTP server is secure and Internet bad guys won't be able to use it to distribute porno and bootlegged software.

WINXP SECURITY: UPDATES & PATCHES

Cumulative Patch for Windows Media Player
I think it was a couple months ago when I wrote about some serious problems with the Windows Media Player (WMP). At that time you could download a "cumulative" patch that would update the Media Player with the latest security fixes. Well, it's time to download another "cumulative" patch! A couple other problems were found in WMP that could cause some problems. To read more about the problem head on over to:
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-WMP_Patch

You'll also find the download locations for Windows Media Player versions 6.4, 7.1 and 8.0 (XP) on that page.
Cumulative Patches for Excel and Word for Windows
If you run Microsoft Word or Excel, versions 2000 or 2002 (XP), then you need to head on over to the Microsoft site to download some security fixes. These fixes handle security glitches that could get you in trouble if you don't take care of them! Head on over to Microsoft's site where you can find individual fixes for each program. You only need download the fix that applies to your computer:

UPGRADING & COMPATIBILITY ISSUES

A Computer May Hang During a Heavy Load with an Ericsson HIS Modem
If your computer has a Ericsson HIS modem, you might experience a dreaded blue screen and see the message IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL. The problem is that you're downloading too much and your poor modem can't keep up! Microsoft recognizes that this isn't a problem with the modem, but with the modem driver. To download a fix visit Microsoft's site. After getting the fix, you can download as much as you like without worrying about blue screens!
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709UP-HIS_Modem
Knowledge Base Search Center - If it is Not Broke, Do Not Break it!
It wasn't so long ago when you could search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for articles that came up in the last 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days and 6 months. It was great! But Microsoft decided to "fix" the Knowledge Base search page, and now it really sucks! It's hard to find things that used to come up easily, the site is often down, and searching based on age of articles just doesn't work anymore.

Try this: go to:
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?ln=EN-US&pr=kbinfo&
and on the left side of the page select Windows XP in the top drop down list box. Don't put anything in the For solutions containing...(optional) text box. Leave the Any of the words entered option selected in the Using drop down list box. For Maximum Age select 3 days. For Results Limit select 150 articles. Click Search Now. Whoa! Nothing. OK, it's reasonable to see no articles related to Windows XP in the last 3 days. Try again, this time using 7 days. Whaat? Still no articles. OK, it was a holiday week in the USA last week. Let's try 14 days. Nothing again! That seems sort of strange, doesn't it? Let's give it another try with 30 days. Still no articles! What's going on here? Keep trying for 6 months and one year. You still won't find anything. It's pretty sad, because this used to work.

WINXP CONFIGURING & TROUBLESHOOTING

A Description of the Repair Option on a Local Area Network or High-Speed Internet Connection
Here's the answer to a question I've had for a long time. What the heck does that "Repair" option for a network connection actually do? It's not in the help file, but it's on the Microsoft Web site. Here's what it does:

Sends an ipconfig /renew
Flushes the ARP cache with a arp -d
Reloads the NetBIOS name cache with a nbtstat -R
Updates its WINS server with an nbtstat -RR
Clear out the DNS client cache with an ipconfig /flushdns
Reregisters the client with a DDNS server with a ipconfig /registerdns

Keyboard and Mouse Do Not Work When You Start Windows
Have you been hit with this one? You're working in Windows XP and shut down for the day. The next morning you start up your Windows XP computer and the mouse pointer is stuck! The only way to get it going again is to restart the computer, and for some reason the pointer starts moving again. What's up with that? I still haven't figured that one out, but Microsoft has a KB article that claims it's from a corrupt registry. I doubt that's the case in my situation because the problem is intermittent. But if you find that your mouse is always stuck, you might want to check out:

White House: President's "War Boner" Must Be Satisfied

..."The President can't seem to hide his excitement about a possible
military conflict with Iraq. At a recent function honoring America's
war widows, Bush sported a visible erection when his speech turned to
the subject of the Middle East.

'Believe me when I say this. With or without the help of other
nations, with or without UN approval, we will penetrate Iraq's
borders. With overwhelming force, we will pound Iraq over and over
again without ceasing. And, once its leaders concede defeat, we will
seed Iraq with American-style democracy.'

Aides say the podium was scrubbed down thoroughly after the event with
a special cleanser/biocide not used since the Clinton
administration.".....

You could also leave it as it currently is and use the

Message-ID:

| The background color in this window is the same as the background
| color in the ftoc.

That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn't
constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background
than others.

In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed.
unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that),
it doesn't need a different background as well.

I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of
horizontal, and see what turns up.

| The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined
| in app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.

OK.

| I've been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for
| other sequences, but haven't got that figured out yet.

In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about.
A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it
displays is a secondary consideration. But as a suggestion, have an
"all unknown" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has
no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated
specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as
a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)

| > > Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
|
| I don't see any reason why not. Experiment and let me know what works for you.

Done some of that. First, the most significant change came from changing
relief from raised to sunken. I don't know why, but it just looks better
(for me anyway). But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a
bit too similar. I ended up using

*sequence_cur: -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2

The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using
had spaces in their names. PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which
is probably safer for generic use.

Thousands spent on strippers, golf memberships
shows Pentagon spending is out of control, Libertarians say

WASHINGTON, DC -- Quiz question: Which of the following items have been
charged to the taxpayers recently by military personnel wielding
government-issued credit cards?

(a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases.

(b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes.

(c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf
membership.

(d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative "river
rock" at a military base in the Arabian desert.

(e) all of the above.

"Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said Steve Dasbach,
Libertarian Party executive director. "Thanks to the federal
government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked,
the military has launched a raid on your wallet."

The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office
audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in "seemingly
unneeded expenditures" made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and
2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax
credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees
carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1
billion in goods and services, the audit found.

In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and
government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars,
then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to
supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their
travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.

"Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a
strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling
suit?" asked Dasbach. "Americans who support a bigger defense budget,
take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated,
reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the
worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even
imagine."

Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury
cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and
armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.

Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit
noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can
be "a useful tool for building good relations with a host country"
such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates.

Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found "little evidence of
documented disciplinary action" against those who misused the cards,
so taxpayers may end up paying the tab.

"It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat
Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse
taxpayers for every penny of improper spending," he said.

"Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard
against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to
force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country,
instead of offending the taxpayer."

Evangelicals' threat to new archbishop

Direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality

Stephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

Evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust
Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes
up his post, by threatening to take "direct action" against him.
The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest
evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,
which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his
supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.
Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met
the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his
appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.
The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to
destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded
with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.
Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has
ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who
have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new
archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the
church.
Nevertheless, the society said: "It is clear that he prefers his private
judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the
common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.
"The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan
Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand
down," it said.
The society claimed to have drawn up an "action plan," including calling on
bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of
which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from
Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be
"taking steps towards appropriate direct action".
It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal
called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles
allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.
Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the
church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown
appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his
appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.
He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be
formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.
Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the
society's chairman, said: "Watch this space." Presumably it could involve a
small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking
alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams
is present.
Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down
during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the
evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the
absence of a robust rebuttal.
A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the
evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical
teaching.
On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of
Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption
and blackmail. "It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is
attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get
your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation," she said.
Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. "Matters of sexuality
should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church
Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his
appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take
the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God."

so i use folder-hooks to accomplish that. as an example (i do line

folder-hook . "my_hdr From: kevin lyda ;"\
"my_hdr X-GPG-Fingerprint: 9C1D 16F4 11F1 6BD2 933C 048D ACC7 9840 89D0 7646;"\

you could also do this with send hooks. i use them to tweak gpg settings:

send-hook ."unset pgp_autoencrypt;set pgp_autosign"
send-hook (ilug|webdev|social)@linux.ie\
"unset pgp_autosign;unset pgp_autoencrypt"

and then i have an include file with all people who have keys.

Weevil pest warms to life in south-west London

James Meek, science correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

They're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy
taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they
are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.
Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold
winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been
detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
"This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory," said
Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London
who discovered the creatures in the UK.
The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous
damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,
otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known
north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. "It's very likely
these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental
plants from Italy," said Dr Barclay. "It looks like they're here to stay."
He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store
in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a
migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in
south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has
established itself firmly in the same area.
Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and
grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The
soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.
One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of
Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a
fact.

Nobel Honors 3 for Astrophysics Work

Tuesday October 8, 2002 12:00 PM
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize in
physics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves in
nature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders.
Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington,
D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering
contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic
X-ray sources.''
Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the other
half of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of the
University of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giant
underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from
the sun by the billion.
Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because
they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.
In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South
Dakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.
Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino
detector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and
also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of
the brightest objects in the universe.
The Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for
building the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and
sharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.
His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the
discovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the
hearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.
When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside
Washington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba
also was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach
Davis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.
This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney
Brenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,
55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the
Karolinska Institute.
The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ
growth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how
viruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as
AIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.
The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday
morning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel later the same day.
The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish
Academy said on Tuesday.
The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -
will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.
The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are
not publicly revealed for 50 years.
Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who
endowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.
In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to
those who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and
``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field
of physics.''
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and
economics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts
in the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted
in strict secrecy.
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in
1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.

LESSON 2: COMPANIES GONE WRONG

Instructors: Bill Mann, TMF Otter (with Matt Richey, TMF Matt)
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690055
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690056

In Lesson 1, we offered a list of red flags that trigger instant
sales. These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with
current events surrounding the companies you hold.

Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing
Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one
reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly
don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems.

Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have
significantly more access to business management than we ever
will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable
insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of
company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond
market (more on this later). "Strong buy?" Pfffffft.

In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is
slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly
valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large
share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple
of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is
priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple
company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business
starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows,
whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular,
it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a
company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals.

So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to
go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning
signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens.

WARNING SIGN 1: SLOWING SALES GROWTH
Through 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of
the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best
capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the
market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted
revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April
2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the
next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E)
company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in
a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a
barnburner like Nokia, one is enough.

Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest
sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they
always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then
canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If
you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and
they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell
trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give
a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on
the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a
year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a
year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly
growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew
sequential growth.)

WARNING SIGN 2: DIVERGENT SALES AND PROFIT GROWTH
By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs
were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies
growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom
lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales
were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end
of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70%
to 40%.

Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to
collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics
changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock
reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the
technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see
signs that something was wrong.

WARNING SIGN 3: PLUMMETING CASH FLOWS
In 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings
perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look
at two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free
cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have
significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash
flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999,
Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion,
based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the
world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications
equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690057
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690058

But as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were
afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an
operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost
$276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in
reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than
$2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference
between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating
cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3
billion, and not in a good way.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690059

The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have
saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999,
Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but
twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow
is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.)

And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on
Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they
weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.

WARNING SIGN 4: WATCH THOSE BONDS
Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's
because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's
almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best
interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the
same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.

Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally
paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the
current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds
bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I
recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of
the bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders
are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same
time analysts are shouting, "Strong buy!"
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690060
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690061

I recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company
and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity
between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced
at 100 is at "par," which means that the bond's face-value
interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some
bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be
lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk.
But some are priced below face value, even way below.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690062

As of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at
18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance
they'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent
problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with
2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not
one that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports
a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than
Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they
don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.

WARNING SIGN 5: "IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER"
For a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the
largest company in the world by market capitalization. This
should have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the
stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion
implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach
$34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings
higher than $12 billion in a single year.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690063

As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco --
it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that
article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any
better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no
signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000,
Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8
billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of
53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then
66% higher.

Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine
a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for
future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the
midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As
investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities.
Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this
point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business
was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot
has to be right for the situation to work out.

HOMEWORK
For this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after
Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you
looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company,
do the following:

- Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four
quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating,
staying about the same, or weakening?

- Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past
four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing
slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures?

- Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past
three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net
income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look
at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around
due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much
more indicative of real cash flow trends.)

- If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center
and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know
whether your company has any debt, just type your company name
into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690064

- Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its
current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is
there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario
already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market,
this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's
still a question you should consider.)

In 2000, Nokia posted revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April 2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E) company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a barnburner like Nokia, one is enough.

Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew sequential growth.)

Warning sign 2: Divergent sales and profit growth By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70% to 40%.

Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see signs that something was wrong.

Warning sign 3: Plummeting cash flowsIn 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look at two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999, Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion, based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.

But as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost $276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3 billion, and not in a good way.

The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999, Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.)

And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.

Warning sign 4: Watch those bonds Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.

Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of the bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same time analysts are shouting, "Strong buy!"

I recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced at 100 is at "par," which means that the bond's face-value interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk. But some are priced below face value, even way below.

As of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance they'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not one that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.

Warning sign 5: "It just doesn't get any better" For a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the largest company in the world by market capitalization. This should have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach $34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings higher than $12 billion in a single year.

As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco -- it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000, Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8 billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of 53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then 66% higher.

Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities. Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot has to be right for the situation to work out.

HomeworkFor this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company, do the following:

Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating, staying about the same, or weakening?

Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures?

Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much more indicative of real cash flow trends.)

If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know whether your company has any debt, just type your company name into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)

Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market, this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's still a question you should consider.)

To help you out, we've put together the Foolish Stock Information Form to track all of your research and information about your stocks. You can get to by clicking here. We've also outlined how to find all of the information above, here.

So dust off the old calculator, find your company's financials, and get to work. Quarterly financial data is best found in company 10-Qs, and annual data is best found in company 10-Ks. You should be able to find all of this information using financials from either the company website or at Fool.com on the Quotes & Data area.

Nick Hilliard's [nick-lists@netability.ie] 52 lines of wisdom included:
The standard release versions of ipfilter are unencumbered, as always.

Nope, indeed IPFW2 has just been rolled out into -STABLE. (-STABLE
is a stable branch of the code that has been rolled into -CURRENT
first. It's basically a major release, that's still a work in
progress)

I'm not so sure that ipfw2 is really ready for production yet, having
only been mfc'd last wednesday. It certainly adds some nice syntactic
sugar, and is apparently much faster for certain types of complex
rulesets. It will be good once it's had some time to settle down a
little.

I would question anything being ready for "production" being in
STABLE.

He's kept backwards compatibility with ipfw, which is major plus.

My point about IPFW2 being rolled out into stable was merely an
illustration of the fact that ipfw is indeed not ipfilter, and that
there are no license issues there :)

Lioness adopts fifth antelope

Rory Carroll, Africa correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

Kamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting
her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled
wildlife experts.
The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her
latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.
Each time Kamuniak, whose name means "the blessed one" in the local Samburu
tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed
the natural mothers to feed them.
Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while
Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by
their natural mothers.
The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari ("taken by
force"), was adopted at the weekend.
"She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony," said
Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden.
Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a
distance.
Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak
is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are
cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour
and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants
to be loved.

Tech stocks drop again on Qwest criminal probe news
Word telecom Qwest Communications International is being investigated by the U.S. Attorney's office in Denver helped send technology shares lower Wednesday.

Despite a Merrill Lynch upgrade of Cisco Systems and the fact that J.P. Morgan began coverage on AOL Time Warner with a "buy" rating, CNET's Tech index fell 26.23 points, or 2.66 percent, to 965.29. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 35.11 points, or 2.54 percent, to 1,346.01--a multi-year low.

Broader markets also shed value, dragged down in part by a troubled pharmaceutical sector. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 282.5 points, or 3.11 percent, to 8,813.5, and the S&P 500 slid 32.36 points, or 3.52 percent, to 920.47--also a multi-year low.

AT&T, Comcast Shareholders OK Broadband Deal
Shareholders of AT&T Corp. and Comcast Corp. on Wednesday approved the planned $27 billion merger of AT&T Broadband with Comcast, which will create the nation's largest cable TV operator with more than 22 million customers.
Telephone giant AT&T in December agreed to sell its cable television unit to Comcast as part of a restructuring that dismantled its vision of becoming a one-stop shop for telephone, data and video services.AT&T CORP 9.78 -2.30%

$215 million later, start-up Pluris shuts down
Networking start-up Pluris will release a statement Wednesday announcing it has closed its doors because of a lack of funding and ongoing woes in the market it serves, according to a spokeswoman familiar with the company's plans.
Pluris, a once promising company, burned through $215 million over the past few years as it attempted to build a high-end router that was intended to outclass similar products from competitors such as Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems.CISCO SYSTEMS 13.51 2.82%

WorldCom contracts under U.S. scrutiny
The accounting scandal at WorldCom has prompted U.S. government agencies to scrutinize the telecommunications company's billions of dollars in federal contracts.
The Federal Aviation Administration, for one, has been forced to take stock of the situation quickly. WorldCom is a finalist for a 20-year, $3.5 billion contract with the FAA. The contract is expected to be awarded as soon as this week. The company is the incumbent on the contract, which supplies phone and data infrastructure to the nation's air traffic control systems.WORLDCOM INC-WORLDCOM TRCK STK 0.20 -3.81%

Banc of America Securities lowers estimates and price target on IBM in notes 7/10/02
Analyst Joel Wagonfeld argues the computer giant is not immune to the persistent, widespread weakness in IT spending. But a roughly 6 percent dip in revenues during the second quarter will be offset by the elimination of losses from the discontinued hard disk drive business, Wagonfeld predicts. In IBM's second-quarter results, he expects continued weakness in hardware but relative strength in software and outsourcing. The company's decision to exit or restructure unprofitable, commodity businesses is sound, Wagonfeld says. He reiterates a "buy" rating on IBM.INTL BUSINESS MACHINES 68.76 -1.31%

If you're going to do any amount of C programming, you should
think about getting K&R2 (The C programming language, 2nd

is Stroustrup. Although the C++ book is a lot bigger :)

* EFF Submits Letter to FCC Chairman Regarding BPDG Proposal

The Honorable Michael K. Powell Chairman Federal Communications
Commission 445 12th Street, S.W. Suite 8C453 Washington, DC 20554

BY FACSIMILE, ELECTRONIC MAIL, AND POSTAL MAIL

Dear Chairman Powell:

I am writing to you today in regards to the digital television
Broadcast Flag; specifically, I write in response to Sen. Hollings'
and Representatives Dingell and Tauzin's letters of July 19, which
urged you to mandate the Broadcast Flag proposal outlined in the
final report of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported
non-profit organization that works to uphold civil liberties
interests in technology policy and law. EFF has played a critical
role in safeguarding crucial freedoms related to computers, the
Internet and consumer electronics devices, defeating the restriction
on strong cryptography exports; securing the legal principle that
Internet wiretaps must only proceed in conjunction with a warrant;
and defending academics, researchers and commercial interests
against DMCA-related prosecution.

EFF was an active participant in the Broadcast Protection Discussion
Group. We attended the group's meetings and conference calls and
participated in the group's policy and technical mailing-lists. EFF
also maintains a web-site that was and is the only public source of
information on the Broadcast Flag negotiations and proposal. The
site can be found at http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org. EFF devoted
thousands of staff-hours to publicizing the existence and nature of
the BPDG to the public, to civil liberties and consumer-advocacy
groups, and to entrepreneurial companies and software authors whose
products were threatened by the proceedings.

When you and I met at Esther Dyson's PC Forum last March, we spoke
briefly about the civil liberties interests that would be undermined
by the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group's mandate. The BPDG
proposal will have grave consequences for innovation, free
expression, competition and consumer interests. Worst of all, it
will add unnecessary complexity and expense to the DTV transition,
compromising DTV adoption itself.

As you are aware, technologists have traditionally manufactured
those devices they believed would be successful in the market, often
in spite of the misgivings of rights-holders. From the piano roll to
the PVR, technologists have enjoyed the freedom to ship whatever
products they believe the public will pay for; what's more,
innovation has always thrived best where there were the fewest
regulatory hurdles. NTSC tuners and devices are governed by precious
few regulations, and consequently we see a rich field of products
that interact with them, from the VCR Plus to tuner-cards for PCs to
the PVR. The Broadcast Flag proposal would limit technologists to
shipping those products that met with the approval of MPAA member
companies. No entrepreneur or software author will know, a priori,
whether his innovative DTV product will be legal in the market until
he has gone to the expense of building it and taking it around to
the Hollywood studios for review.

Consumers and industry alike have benefitted greatly from the "Open
Source" or "Free Software" movement, in which technologies are
distributed in a form that encourages end-user modification. From
server-software like the web-wide success-story apache, to operating
systems like GNU/Linux, to consumer applications like the Mozilla
browser, Free Software is a powerful force for innovation, consumer
benefit and commercial activity. The BPDG proposal implicitly bans
Free Software DTV applications -- such as the DScaler de-interlacer
and the GNU Radio software-defined radio program -- as these
applications are built to be modified by end-users, something that
is banned under the BPDG proposal. The tamper-resistance component
of the BPDG's "Robustness Requirements" will create and entire class
of illegal software applications, abridging the traditional First
Amendment freedom enjoyed by software authors who create expressive
speech in code form under one of several Free Software/Open Source
licenses.

The BPDG nominally set out to create an objective standard, a bright
line that technologists could hew to in order to avoid liability
when deploying their products. However, the end product of the BPDG
was a "standard" that contained no objective criteria for legal
technology; rather, the standard required that new technologies be
approved by MPAA member companies. Not uncoincidentally, the only
technologies that were approved by the MPAA -- and hence the only
legal technologies -- were those produced by the 4C and 5C
consortia, a group of technology companies that acted as the MPAA's
allies throughout the BPDG process. This is an harbinger of the sort
of regime that the BPDG standard will usher in: technology companies
will be able to shut their competitors out of the marketplace by
allying themselves with Hollywood, brokering deals to allow certain
technologies and outlaw others.

The marketplace is a proven mechanism for rapidly and efficiently
producing products that increase the value and desirability of new
technologies, such as DTV. A BPDG mandate would subvert the market
for DTV innovation. Competing companies with lower-cost DTV
technology alternatives would be restrained from bringing these to
market if they failed to assuage the MPAA's concerns about
unauthorized redistribution. Furthermore, the universe of
unauthorized-but-lawful uses for DTV programming will be shrunk down
to the much smaller space of explicitly authorized uses. The ability
of the public to make unauthorized-but-lawful uses of television
programming has been an historical force for increasing the value of
broadcast programming, from the VCR to the PVR.

Ironically, the inevitable damage that a Broadcast Flag mandate
would do to innovation, competition and consumer interests can only
slow down DTV adoption, by driving up the cost of DTV devices while
reducing the number of desirable features that an open market would
create. If the public is offered less functionality for more money,
they will not flock to DTV.

The most disheartening thing about the Broadcast Flag is that there
is neither a strong case that the Broadcast Flag is a necessary tool
for protecting copyright, nor that the Broadcast Flag would be
effective in that role. The existing practice of Internet
infringement of broadcast programming -- analog captures from
devices that satisfy the requirements of the BPDG proposal -- would
not be stopped by the presence of a Broadcast Flag.
Higher-resolution DTV signals will likewise present no challenge to
determined infringers, who can capture full-quality analog signal
from DTV devices and then re-digitize them, suffering only a single
generation's worth of loss-of-quality before the programming enters
the Internet.

Meanwhile, the underlying rubric for a Broadcast Flag -- that
infringement will undermine Hollywood's business to the point that
movies will no longer be available to the public, reducing the value
of DTV -- is no more than superstition. No credible study or
analysis, undertaken by a neutral party, has ever been presented to
Congress, the FCC, the CPTWG or the BPDG supporting this notion. The
public is being asked to sacrifice its rights in copyright; industry
is being asked to place its right to innovation in the hands of
entertainers; the US government is being asked to mandate
extraordinary, unprecedented regulation of the $600 billion
technology sector -- all on the uncorroborated opinions of a few
studio executives.

EFF welcomes the FCC's oversight of the Broadcast Flag issue. The
BPDG proceedings took place behind a shroud of secrecy, in a
looking-glass "public process" where only those participants the
organizers wanted to hear from were made privy to its existence,
where the co-chairs invented rules and processes on the fly to suit
the needs of the entertainment interests and the technology
companies that had privately secured a promise of a legal monopoly
for their products, where the press was banned.

The FCC has an admirable tradition of seeking and weighing public
opinion in its proceedings. As the FCC considers the Broadcast Flag,
EFF hopes that it will start anew, setting aside the findings of the
BPDG in light of the concerns raised by Microsoft, Philips, Sharp,
Thomson, and Zenith, as well as non-profit organizations including
EFF, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, the Free
Software Foundation, Public Knowledge, digitalconsumer.org, the
Center for Democracy in Technology, and the Computer and
Communications Industry Association.

Thank you for attention in this matter. Please let me know if we can
be of any further assistance to you.

Sincerely yours,

Cory Doctorow for the Electronic Frontier Foundation

* Update on Intel Corp. v. Hamidi

Intel Corp. v. Hamidi is now on appeal to the California Supreme
Court. EFF filed an amicus brief in support of Ken Hamidi on Aug. 6,
2002. The facts are simple: Over about two years, Hamidi on six
occasions sent e-mail critical of Intel's employment practices to
between 8,000 and 35,000 Intel employees. Intel demanded that Hamidi
stop, but he refused. Intel obtained an injunction barring Hamidi
from e-mailing Intel employees at their Intel e-mail addresses,
based on the common-law tort of "trespass to chattels." ("Chattel"
is a legal term that refers to personal property, as opposed to
property in land.)

EFF's amicus brief argues three main points.

(1) Intel did not qualify for relief under "trespass to chattels"
because Intel's e-mail servers were not themselves harmed by
Hamidi's e-mails. If Intel was harmed, it was because the content of
Hamidi's e-mails affected Intel employees, not because sending the
e-mails affected the functioning of Intel's servers.

(2) By focusing on unwanted "contact" with the chattel and ignoring
the harm requirement, the court of appeal turned "trespass to
chattels" into a doctrine that threatens common Internet activity
like search engines and linking. For example, if a website posted a
"no trespassing" sign, any "contact" by a search engine could be
considered a trespass even if it caused no harm.

(3) The court of appeal wrongly held that the injunction did not
infringe Hamidi's freedom of speech. The First Amendment limits
private parties' legal remedies in many areas of law, such as libel,
out of concern that private parties will use the law to suppress
criticism. The same principle should apply here, where Intel's
claims of harm stem from the meaning of Hamidi's speech.

* DeCSS Author Johansen's Trial Rescheduled

The trial of Norwegian teen Jon Johansen, who created the
controversial DeCSS software, has been pushed back again. It is now
scheduled to be heard on December 9, 2002, in Oslo, Norway. In the
fall of 1999, Johansen and his team reverse-engineered the content
scrambling system (CSS) software used to encrypt DVDs in an effort
to build a DVD player for the Linux operating system. In January of
2002, the Norwegian Economic Crime Unit (OKOKRIM) charged Johansen
with a violation of Norwegian Criminal Code Section 145.2, which
outlaws breaking into a third-party's property in order to steal
data that one is not entitled to. This prosecution marks the first
time the law will be used to prosecute a person for accessing his
own property (his own DVD). Johansen faces two years in prison if
convicted. The prosecution is based on a formal complaint filed by
the Motion Picture Association.

The trial had originally been scheduled to take place in June of
2002 but was rescheduled when the court could not find any qualified
judges to hear Johansen's case. Now the case is scheduled to be
heard by a three-judge panel. Help Jon in his battle against
Hollywood movie studios, donate to his legal defense fund at:

* Bunnie Presents Paper on XBox Reverse Engineering

Paper Explains Flaw in Videogame Security System

Researcher Escapes Chilling Effect of Digital Copyright Law

Electronic Frontier Foundation Media Advisory

For Immediate Release: Thursday, August 9, 2002

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is pleased
to announce that former MIT doctoral student Andrew "Bunnie" Huang
will present a paper explaining a security flaw in the Microsoft
Xbox (TM) videogame system.

Huang will present his paper, "Keeping Secrets in Hardware: the
Microsoft X-BOX Case Study," at 5:25 p.m. PDT on August 13, 2002, at
the 2002 Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems
(CHES 2002) in Redwood City, California (Aug. 13-15, 2002).

The Xbox security system is intended to allow people to play only
videogames authorized by Microsoft. Huang's paper "shows how a
person could defeat that system with a small hardware investment,"
said MIT Professor Hal Abelson, one of Huang's advisors. "More
importantly, the paper relates the security vulnerability to a
general design flaw shared by other high-profile security systems
such as the government's Clipper Chip and the movie industry's
Contents Scrambling System (CSS) for DVD players."

Huang contacted EFF in March after his advisors told him that his
preliminary findings raised potentially significant legal questions.
With the help of Boston College law professor Joe Liu, EFF worked
with Huang, Abelson, and MIT administrators to analyze the legal
issues and draft letters notifying Microsoft of Huang's research
findings and intended publication, one of the steps encouraged by
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

Microsoft told Huang and Abelson that while it might prefer that the
paper not be published, it would be inappropriate to ask MIT to
withhold the paper.

"Microsoft deserves praise for making no attempt to control
publication," said Abelson. "Their response shows that they value
academic freedom, and that they appreciate the critical role of
unfettered research and publication in advancing technology."

Other companies have reacted otherwise, using the DMCA to threaten
researchers. The Recording Industry Association of America last year
warned Princeton Professor Edward Felten after his research team
exposed weaknesses in digital music security technologies. Last
month, Hewlett Packard (HP) threatened research collective SnoSoft
over exposing a security vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix operating
system. Soon after, HP clarified that it would not use the DMCA to
stifle research or impede the flow of information that would improve
computer security.

Huang said that while he is glad he can openly present his paper,
"The DMCA clearly had a chilling effect on my work. I was afraid to
submit my research for peer review until after the EFF's efforts to
clear potential legal restraints."

"Researchers should be analyzing security, not worrying about
getting sued," said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien.

Honor Harrington series to date, as well as other titles from the
Baen line, including Keith Laumer's *Retief!* and Larry Niven and
Jerry Pournelle's *Fallen Angels*.

Baen has been a banner-carrier for fair-use in electronic
publishing, shipping text and html files that can be played on a
multitude of devices. Other publishers have chosen to publish their
material in copy-controlled formats that make it impossible to
legally loan or resell the titles you purchase, are locked to a
specific device, can't play on every operating system, and
occasionally lock out assistive technology like the screen-readers
employed by the blind.

Dmitry Skylarov, a Russian scientist, was arrested in July 2001, for
demonstrating how end-users could defeat the copy-prevention
employed by Adobe's e-book technology. Adobe asked the FBI to arrest
Skylarov for violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),
which makes it a crime to describe techniques for circumventing
copy-prevention technology. Though Skylarov was later released, his
employer, ElcomSoft, is still facing charges in the USA, and the
Russian government has issued an advisory warning Russian scientists
to steer clear of American technical conferences until the DMCA is
repealed.

Here is Baen's statement on the CD release:

You are about to start playing with a CD-ROM that has fairly
extraordinary content. As of this writing it includes twenty-two
UNENCRYPTED novels in several formats, the ten Honor Harrington
Novels, 3 Honor Harrington Anthologies and 9 novels by friends of
Honor, and by the time of distribution it may well contain more.
(More than twenty novels for free, and with no stupid codes to work
around. Think of that.) The reason for the plethora of formats is to
try to please the people who want to read the novels on their Palm
Pilots or other text-specialized palm-sized devices.

Clearly you've never met "Triumph", the Fabulous Crotch-Sniffing
Caymanian Customs Wonder Dog at extreme close range, or heard the
story about the expat's college age kid, actually born on Cayman, who
was literally exiled from the island when the island constabulary
"discovered" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break rental car
a few years back.

I mean, his old man was some senior cheese at Global Crossing at the
time, but this was back when they could do no wrong. If that's what
they did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former
junk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd
unauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty
keeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a
bottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting
nocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't
help thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman
van's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't
gonna be pretty.

Closer to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were
hustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on
Grand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple
of years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active
shooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a
few days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff,
reeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal
examinations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two,
courtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and
games with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog.
Heck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed
Caymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left.

Besides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their
activities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too
much in the way of "escaped" "revenue", or at least the perception of
same in the local "free" press. Obviously, if your money "there"
isn't exchangeable into your money "here", it kind of defeats the
purpose of keeping your money "there" in the first place, giving
folks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up
for renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line
credit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or
quango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and
the US.

As a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while
ago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom
on that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes
Luxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually
accessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans
themselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling
about one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing
pretexts.

At this point, the "legal", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings
are kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep
my money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where
a bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will
close it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned
statutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or
imagined property rights are this afternoon.

The point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only
solution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private
transactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than "transparent"
transactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real*
interesting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal
freedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and
groom action figures sold separately, of course.

Cheers,
RAH
(Who went to FC2K at the Grand Cayman Marriott in February that year.
Nice place, I liked Anguilla better though, at least at the time, and
I haven't been back to either since. The beaches are certainly better
in Anguilla, and the "private" banking system there is probably just
as porous as Cayman's is, by this point. If I were to pick up and
move Somewhere Free outside Your Friendly Neighborhood Unipolar
Superpower, New Zealand is somewhere near the top of my list, and
Chile would be next, though things change quickly out there in
ballistic-missile flyover country. In that vein, who knows, maybe
we're in for some kind of latter-day Peloponnesian irony, and
*Russia* will end up the freest place on earth someday. Stranger
things have happened in the last couple of decades, yes?)

David asked:
My wife noticed something odd. The nearly-full moon was about 30
degrees above the horizon. There was a notable glow on the horizon,
except under the moon. The moon seemed to be in a column of darkness
that was about three times the apparent width of the moon. We could see
the column over its entire length as a strip of sky darker than the sky
around it.

Any of you ever see this? Do you have any idea what could have caused
it? I suspect it's due to some pecularity of the visual system, but
have no clear idea.

I'm surprised to not find this phenomenon in Corlis. I could have sworn I
saw it there. He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow
and a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a
semi-circle of darker sky.

I know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't
recall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of
things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm
sorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on
atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.

Going rapidly OT here, but I find it shocking that anybody could be
proud of not knowing something. It's like the tourist on holidays using
that speak-loudly-enough-and-they-will-understand technique or (slightly
less off-topic) the friend or relative who says "I know nothing
about computers!" and clearly doesn't intend to learn, and is happy
to let you clean up after them.

I certainly agree that Irish is not taught all that well (or wasn't
when I was in school) but I'd like to be able to relearn it and to
count it as one of my skills.

An illusionist has emerged after 24 hours underwater in a case in New York's
Times Square.

I'd just like to recommend the newest Viz to ukers just for the hilarious "David
Blaine: Stalag Magician". The ego'd one is in a WWII prison camp and sort of
trying to escape. Several times he seems to have escaped and the british
officers celebrate before it's revealed he's been buried alive or hiding in a
freezer. At one point he's asked why and says "Well it's not for publicity"
Cracking stuff.

Ripped from

http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Linux.Wireless.usage.html

" 11 Access Points, Home Gateways and Ethernet bridging
Most Access Points act as a MAC level bridge, allowing the Wireless LAN to
be a natural extension of a wired network. They are deployed in a cellular
fashion, and provide extended security, management and roaming.
On the other hand, the Home Gateways allow a single cell to be connected to
a WAN, like a modem, a cable modem or a DSL access. The set of features is
quite different, and they offer NAT/masquerading and PPP configuration.

The conventional Ethernet bridging method (promiscuous sniffing) doesn't
work with most wireless LAN standard, because of the header encapsulation
and the interactions with link layer retransmissions. In other word, most
often, when you use a software bridge on a wireless LAN (such as the Linux
bridge on a 802.11 card), it doesn't work (moreover, quite often promiscuous
is broken as well). "

[[ What the?? What is he talking about?? Aren't we all using Linux to bridge
our networks? ]]

" The driver could work around this restriction by creating its own MAC
headers (802.11 headers instead of 802.3, and putting the right bits in the
right place), but in fact most vendors don't provide the specification on
how to this with their hardware (when they don't explicitely prevent it in
hardware, to force you to buy their Access Points).

In other words, don't expect to use your Linux PC as a wireless bridge or
wireless Access Points with most products out there, and forget about
turning it into an Access Point. Of course, there is some exceptions. "

[[ Is this true? ]]

" The workaround is to set the wireless LAN in ad-hoc mode and to use other
methods, such as routing, masquerading, IP bridging, ARP proxying... "

[[ Yes, I am in a process of building a wireless-lan wired-lan bridge.
But I don't understand what this guy is talking about. Anyone?

Britons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in Europe

John Carvel, social affairs editor
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Not every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
1,047.2mm.
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
average.
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.

Any chance of having that lengthen instead? I like all my exmh stuff
in nice columns (fits the display better). That is, I use the detache
d
folder list, one column. The main exmh window takes up full screen,
top to bottom, but less than half the width, etc...

I thought about that. The first order approximation would be to just add
using pack .... -side top instead of pack ... -side left, however, since their
each a different width, it would look funny.

I've done this. It's not as pretty as I think it should be, but it works.
I'm going to leave the cosmetic issues to others. When I update the
documentation, I'll add this to the exmh.TODO file.

I'm leaving for a 2 1/2 week vacation in a week, so this is the last new
functionality I'm going to add for a while. Also, I now have pretty much
everything in there that I want for my own use, so I'm probably pretty much
done. I'll work on bug fixes and documentation before my vacation, and
hopefully do nothing more afterwards.

Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected
By Bruce Johnston in Rome
(Filed: 28/08/2002)

Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's
traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six
people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.

Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena
Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio
nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,
contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.

Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take
part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the
off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.

Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa
did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.

As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his
mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.

Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,
was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.

Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police
yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers
from video footage.

Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as
contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact
that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.

The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on
the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade
through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.
But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.

The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary
undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last
minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not
grab their reins.

The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'
boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend
Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.

The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles
of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of
the Assumption of the Virgin.

Ah right. Actually, sysctl -a was more helpful - shows why setting

Hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him

Rod Liddle
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman
to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing
with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.
I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on
statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the
way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the
sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,
and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen
for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and
maybe me and you, too.
But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the
Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded
happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic
proto-warriors in the background.
You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily
Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye
covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't
mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom
we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come
off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the
British right) as "Captain Hook", in articles which usually call for his
arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe
off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and
thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if
we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him
to shut up.
Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before
September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all
thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political
persecution.
And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've
got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory
manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of
context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But
perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and
tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's
scoop.
Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier
this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his
allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were
meant to do stuff like that.
He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been
frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the
media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations
and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly
- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be
true - Hamza is not "representative" of British Muslims, as if British
Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could
turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.
The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was
revealed to be rather more "representative" than the list of those
government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -
dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism
and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.
An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an
overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.
One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US
(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought
the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.
Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the
time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at
home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from
the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US
foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action
against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.
Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't
suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,
the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful
for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.
Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has
been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more
inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His
ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be
happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for
example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly
repellent.
And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire
to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful
appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the
ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.
Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that
are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.
The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing
remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution
is simply the pungency of his views.
It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his
rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This
is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.
You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And
if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of
unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is
not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man
up, therefore, won't make a difference.
It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:
The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.
But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.

IN THIS ISSUE:

01. Secure IE
02. Disk cleanup on XP
03. Thanks but no thanks
04. Mouseless way home
05. Kartoo
06. XP time feature
07. Leaf Peeper Alert

09. Quick access
10. Don't believe your email

And What's Coming Up Next Week in NNT Premium

01. SECURE IE. For the past month or so, our Software Review Panel has
been giving a grueling test to Secure IE, a piece of software that blocks
Flash and pop-ups, prevents malicious file downloads, lets you customize
Security Zone settings as you browse dozens of Web sites simultaneously up
to five times faster with a tabbed interface, annotate Web page with sticky
notes and highlighter, and save complete Web pages, even secure server
(HTTPS) pages and archive online transaction receipts. For what we believe
is one of the most thorough reviews ever conducted on a single piece of
software, check out what our Panel had to say at
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/SoftwareReviews . For a free trial download,
visit http://www.secureie.com . And if this one sweeps you off your feet,
go to the NNT Store at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store and get a super
deal, just $17.50 if you order before September 14. With a 30-day
guarantee, what's to lose?

02. DISK CLEANUP ON XP. Windows XP users can do some fast cleaning chores
with Disk Cleanup. Access this tool from the Start menu by right clicking
on your hard drive. Then select Properties and click on the Disk Cleanup
button to determine how many files can be safely deleted.

03. THANKS BUT NO THANKS. Continuing our periodic feature of
less-than-useful sites on the Web: The International Center for Bathroom
Etiquette at http://www.icbe.org/ gets our recognition this issue. It says
it's working hard to bring you the latest in cutting edge research and
technology regarding bathroom etiquette. We'll resist some obvious puns.

. . . . .

West Virginia's Diane Stratton recommended NNT to some friends and is now
enjoying QuicKeys 2.0, a great Windows management software package. Diane
is our latest winner and you could be next. Just go to the NNT Web site at
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com and click on "Recommend NNT." Nothing could
be easier.

. . . . .

04. MOUSELESS WAY HOME. To go home quickly in Internet Explorer, touch F6
to highlight the Address Bar and type two periods (..) there. The Enter
key then takes you home.

05. KARTOO. Search engines are everywhere on the Internet but Kartoo at
http://www.kartoo.net is quite unusual. It's a meta search engine that
displays results on a map in the form of a ball. The larger the ball, the
more relevant the result. As you mouseover each result, site descriptions
are revealed. If all that sounds confusing, the explanation is more
complicated than the service itself. Just try it.

. . . . .

You should make it a habit to visit the NNT Store at
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store . We try to have several great products
there at a limited-time price much less than anywhere else on the Net.
Currently, you'll find excellent ebooks, a very effective popup stopper,
and the very useful utility described in item 01 above, along with the
usual opportunity to subscribe to NNT Premium and ArchivesExpress. Check
us out, you'll be glad you did.

. . . . .

06. XP TIME FEATURE. Windows XP added a nice feature that heretofore
required a separate software application. It will connect, either at a
programmed time or manually, to a time server via the Internet and reset
that often erroneous internal clock. Just click on the time in the systems
tray, go to Date and Time Properties and click the Internet Time tab.

07. LEAF PEEPER ALERT. A bit early, but soon the changing colors of autumn
will begin here in the U.S. For those who like to follow the display,
consider http://www.stormfax.com/foliage.htm for a comprehensive collection
of links and toll-free numbers to each state to determine peak color times.

08. SAVINGS SCRAPS. Some oldies are worth repeating. If you're working
with text in, for example, MS Word or WordPad, and would like a handy way
to save a portion for later easy retrieval, just select (highlight) it and
click/drag it to your desktop. When the newly created icon is clicked on,
it will show the application with which the scrap was created, along with
the first few words of the text. A double click opens the text in the
application with which it was created.

09. QUICK ACCESS. To go to a frequently used program, you may find
yourself drilling down to the desktop and searching out the shortcut
icon. Consider instead setting up a key combination that will provide
quick access without using the shortcut. Right click on the shortcut and
select Properties. In the Shortcut key window, select any key you can
remember and click OK. Ctrl+Alt and that key will open the application
whenever needed.

10. DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EMAIL. We've been asked about those emails with
virus attachments that appear to be coming from NNT, asking for a
confirmation of a subscription. Don't believe it, and don't open the
attachments. Maybe this exchange between NNT and Lyris (our mail manager)
will clear things up:

NNT: Is there anything that can be done about the current strains of virus
that implant on address books and randomly send email asking alleged
subscribers to verify their subscription (when they haven't subscribed at
all)? I've received some of these as well, and I know it's become a
widespread problem with other ezine publishers, creating a lot of ill will
all around. Is there some configuration that we could change to keep
these from going out except to legitimate subscribers?

Lyris: Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about this since it
isn't actually ListManager doing the sending. The real problem is that
people sometimes will add the "join" address to their address book and
that is what causes the problems. The best we can do is advise people not
to have their address books set to automatically add any email address
that they send a message to even once. The main culprit here seems to be
Outlook Express.

WHAT'S COMING NEXT WEEK: Another batch of Neat Net Tricks in the Premium
issue, including:

* A great collection of information and free downloads to make your system
more secure.

* Free software to measure and display your real-time Internet speed.

* Can you handle still another popup stopper - that's interference free -
and at no cost?

* An easy-to-use tool to store and arrange all your passwords, user IDs,
and other info.

* A Microsoft Word tip to easily work around that pesky autocompletion
feature.

* A whole arsenal of tools to combat spam.

* Software that provides more than 200 interesting facts about your
computer and displays about your CPU, memory, operating system, and your
computer's power source.

* Our in-depth article discusses how to best manage our important
passwords and get out of trouble when we -inevitably - forget those passwords.

And more! If you haven't subscribed yet, you won't find a better source of
useful information for just 42 cents per issue. That's $10 for a year's
worth - 24 issues - at the NNT Store, http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store .

you need to do a "fdisk /mbr" from a bootable windoze floppy
alternatively boot from linux boot disk and do fdisk, delete all partitions.

I need to ask a question concerning this issue.

What if I don't want to get rid of the MBR -- it will destroy the OS
on that drive. How do I remove lilo without the above fdisk
procedure?

CONFECTIONERY THEORY>> "Are you tracking breakfast cereal?"
inquired a concerned LLOYD WOOD, after recently wandering into
the "kiddy end" of the cereal aisle. "They've all gone CD-ROM
on the front", he observed - causing him, for a moment to
think he was looking at "some really bloated computer
magazines". Of course we are, Lloyd, though we're not as
easily swayed by gimmicks as you are, and thus can impartially
report that NESTLE's Maryland-style COOKIE CRISP are the most
biscuit-like breakfast ever, easily triumphing over KELLOGG's
FROSTIES CHOCOLATE (too much chocolate, not enough "frosty"),
COCO POPS CRUNCHERS (clump together in this humid weather) and
even the Winnie The Pooh-themed DISNEY HUNNY B's - and if you

Reader ED AVIS complains that KFC don't tell you that their
"M&M" AVALANCHE (also 99p) does not feature real M&Ms but
"special miniaturised ones", which he describes as "frozen
solid" and "might as well be small bits of gravel for all the
chocolate flavour they impart". While, following last week's
announcement of Ice T's Posse Pops, CRAIG LEFF thought we'd be
reassured by the news that NBC are launching their own range
of TV-themed Baskin-Robbins ice-creams, including a "Fear
Factor" flavour designed to recreate the experience of eating
"dirt and spiders": http://www.adage.com/news.cms?newsId=35520
... back with confectionery, LEON VERRALL remained unimpressed
with STARBURST FRUITINESSE (from 49p, "tasted of plastic...
[resembled] those 'food pills' they thought we'd all be eating
by now"), DAVID BLANE grudgingly approved of the TWIX TRIPLE
CHOC LIMITED EDITION ("Not bad, faintly evoking Penguins,
which I never liked because of the thick chocolate"), and the
whole point of that controversial "It's not for girls"

Internet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro

NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and
ask for our votes.

Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.

In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.

That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.

Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones
through any of those channels.

The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.

His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money
in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication
mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.

No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society,
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different
unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.

The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.

When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them
to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60
percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail
accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.

Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better
ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient
groups.

But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter
an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without
opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage
the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam
advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail.
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an
advocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro,
the former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is
founder and president of a political e-marketing firm. This was written
for the Los Angeles Times.

Greetings from Download.com!
If you're developing Windows applications in an
ActiveX-compatible environment (which includes most major ones
such as Visual Basic and C++), it's time you started taking
advantage of prefab programming components. An amazing array of
controls are out there, with more arriving at Download.com
every day. This week, we've collected the top programs that
handle transparent GIF files, offer prebuilt ActiveX controls,
and edit hex code to get you up and running.

Also this week, we've got two really useful ActiveX entries:
FileSystem 1.2 and AppSecureX 2.9. FileSystem gives you access
to drives, folders, and I/O operations; and AppSecureX adds
serial number and shareware-type functionality to your
applications.

Becky Waring
Contributing Editor, CNET Download.com

From Builder.com

Six
MySQL/PHP functions to streamline development
Code reuse is one of the keys to increasing developer
productivity. This article looks at several handy functions
you can use to save time when building applications using
PHP and MySQL.

Faking
SOAP principles with familiar techniques
SOAP is everywhere you turn. But what exactly is it? Take
this guided tour to gain working knowledge of this emerging
standard.

in ActiveX

FileSystem 1.2
Having problems wrangling the Windows File System? The
FileSystem ActiveX control offers complete access to common
file information under Windows through three independent
interfaces. Everything from drive and folder access to file
I/O operations is available with only a few lines of code.
Use this control's interfaces to detect media types and
media insertion, get complete lists of folders and files at
unlimited folder depth, find out what attributes are set on
files, and even load logbook files into collections
automatically. Rope in your files.

ApSecureX 2.9
Prevent pirates from copying your software with AppSecureX.
This control provides a registration system that produces a
valid serial number customized to the user's machine. When
the user installs your software, a unique ID number is
generated for that system. To get the serial number, the
user must provide you with his installation number. The
data file created by the application is encrypted
differently for each system, so even if someone were to
crack the file, they couldn't use the information on
another machine. AppSecure can also give your software
shareware functionality such as number of days left, checking
to see if the system clock is set back, and so on. AppSecureX
works with any ActiveX-enabled programming language such as
Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++. A demo
application is included. Lock up your software.

in Java
AppletFile 2.5
AppletFile is a set of Java applets that will enhance your
Web site's file upload and download capabilities. In
addition to support for SSL, proxy, and authenticated
uploading, users can upload and download multiple files
using predefined paths to automate the process as much as
possible. A scripting language provides for sophisticated
customization, and the user interface includes support for
12 different languages. Transfers are faster because the
applet uses its own compression (AutoZIP). The AutoSYNC
feature downloads only updated files, and verification of
file transfer integrity is made possible with built-in
support for MD5 message digests. AppletFile is based on
HTTP protocols and is firewall-friendly. This update adds
Sun's Java Plug-in support for Netscape 6+ browsers and
shows removable media drives in the browse dialog. Beam up
your files.

in Tools & Editors

PHP Master Editor 2.0
Write, edit, and debug PHP scripts and HTML pages with this
tool. PHP Master Editor includes an internal browser for
viewing, as well as a debugger for local testing. Basic FTP
capability is also included. Specifically designed for PHP
programmers, the program recognizes and formats functions,
variables, and classes within the code, and features
customizable code templates. Get code-happy.

Hi all,

apologies for the possible silly question (i don't think it is, but),
but is Eircom's aDSL service NAT'ed?

and what implications would that have for VoIP? I know there are
difficulties with VoIP or connecting to clients connected to a NAT'ed
network from the internet wild (i.e. machines with static, real IPs)

any help pointers would be helpful,

cheers

I'm not a banker, and I'm not a credit expert - but these people
speak from personal and professional experience. Draw your own
conclusions. Lockergnomie Sang Vo writes: "Though you may have
zero liability for a fraudulent transaction, the paperwork and red
tape to work through if someone empties out all your funds can
leave you hurting for a while. There are many credit cards that
now offer zero liability for fraudulent transactions. So, contact
your credit card provider / bank to see if you can have such a
plan added to your card or if you can apply for one that does."
And Russ Coover continues: "If you purchase something with a
credit card, and you later decide to dispute the purchase (for a
reason such as the product was faulty and the merchant refuses to
replace it or, perhaps the product was never delivered), you can
legally dispute the charge with your credit card company. However,
if you use a debit card to make that purchase, you have no right
to dispute the charge."

Jeff Morgan has a different interpretation of the regulation in
question (E): "In 12 CFR II, Section 205.6, it's saying that if
you give your financial institution timely notice of the theft of
your card or PIN code (two business days), you are liable for no
more than $50, otherwise you may be liable for up to $500." And
Tim Miller extends the translation: "If someone puts a false
charge on a credit card, the worse that will happen is your
liability for $50, with the possibility that your next charge
might not go through because the thief used all of your available
balance. If a false charge goes against your debit card and wipes
out your bank balance, however, outstanding checks can bounce.
Your bank may be able to get you all of your money back, but the
payees of those bounced checks might sock you with $20-25
insufficient fund fees - and they are under no obligation to waive
those fees. If you have 5 checks outstanding, you could be out
over $100."

Frank Reyes was apparently lucky: "Someone recently obtained my
debit card number through a local grocery store. I was told by the
checker at the grocery store that the card readers would only
accept Visa cards not ATM cards. I was very suspicious, and used
my debit card instead. Apparently, the store's computer had been
hacked, and my debit card number and name (among several
others)were forwarded to an unscrupulous individual. I was
reviewing my checking account online two days later, and noticed
an unauthorized charge against my account ($60.00). I contacted
the vendor that had charged my account and informed them of the
fraudulent charge. The vendor stopped the shipment, provided the
shipping address to my bank, and credited my account within 5 days
after I informed them (The delay in the fund reversal was due to
the 4th of July weekend). The only negative aspect is the fact
that I had to request a new debit card, which has yet to arrive."

Further thoughts from Lockergnomie James Simbro: "I'm not totally
sure on this, but I've been warned against using a debit card for
online purchases. Yes, you may not be liable for any of the
false charges on a debit card (in the end), but in the meantime
(during your dispute) the money will be withheld from your account
and you will not have access to it. However with a credit card,
you are not responsible for funds that are in dispute. The
scenario I was given, was imagine if somebody falsely used your
debit card and cleaned out your checking account? The money is
gone! False charges on a credit card are not "real money" until
somebody has to pay them. I would guess that each bank has
different policies for debit card fraud. I might just have to call
mine and see what I'd face." In short, be careful - no matter what
you use or where you choose to use your plastic.

See You in August, Chris Pirillo

{Manage your collections} It seems like everyone collects

collecting dust. It's much easier than collecting stamps. If you
do collect stamps, though, this organizer will help you keep track
of them all. Or you can use it to keep track of your Star Wars

"This site makes it easy to transfer files to your Web server.
Mostly it is useful for sites like FlamingText.com and

no pre-set limits (okay, it's 2.4 GB), the transfers that you do
through Transloader.com must be completed in five minutes. This
server is capable of transferring over 1 Gig per minute; if you
are talking to a slow server, your job may not complete in time.

To Share or Not to Share
Scribbled by Lee Smith

I think that online file sharing is dependent on the file that is
being shared. If the song is a current release or recent, then I
do not believe in it. I can't consider it stealing because you
can't steal from someone who willingly puts the file up for
downloading. Those who did put the file online most likely feel
that it is also not stealing, since they purchased the CD.
However, I do not agree with RIAA or recording companies who are
attempting to make their CDs "rip proof" either. I do not feel
they have the right to dictate what songs I can listen to or when
or in what order. I like to rip specific songs from CDs then make
my own CD, which either goes down to my entertainment system or to
my truck. The master CD is saved and rarely played ("why" is
explained later in this message). I prefer making my own CDs for
my truck because if my truck were to be broken into and my CDs
stolen, it would be much easier to replace a self-burned CD than a
master. Sometimes, masters cannot be replaced without a large
expense, if at all.

If the song is outdated, an oldie (so to speak), and is not
available anywhere, then yes, I do believe in it. Or, if the song
being sought is wanted to rejuvenate one's collection, then yes, I
do believe in that, too. Case in point: as a kid, I collected a
lot of 45s and record albums. I have more than 4,000 records in my
collection. Many were played so much that they are not playable
anymore and, even though I did take care of them, due to the cheap
stereos and record players in the 60s, they are 'shot.' I want to
relive some of my younger days through music, but attempting to
convert those records (to digital) is next to impossible for me.
So, in this instance, no, I do not think it is illegal to seek out
digitalized copies of the old songs that I already have records of
(albums and/or 45s). If, however, the song(s) that I am seeking
are available on CD, then I will be very quick to purchase that CD
from Tower Records, The Warehouse, or any other reputable dealer.

For those that are impossible to find "digitals" for, then, one
day, perhaps I will reach a point with technology (and money)
where I can transfer those platters to WAV and they will sound as
good as when they were originally recorded. I have been lucky
enough to find some on CD thanks to the Internet; I was quick to
purchase the disc, usually from the original artists themselves.
Some of the music that I have, sadly, will never be heard again. I
blame RIAA and the recording industry for that, too. Neither seem
to care about the "lost" songs when digitally remastered CDs are
released.

Who can save you from making a small oversight with your digital
video camera purchase? Lockergnomie Frank Kenna: "I see that
you're thinking of getting a DV camera. I got one about a month
ago, and I made one mistake: I didn't get one with A/V INPUTS.
Mine has A/V outputs, which are great for getting your digital
stuff out onto VHS, etc. But without the inputs, there's no way to
get VHS or old 8mm footage into the camera. With inputs, not only
can you get your old 8mm & VHS stuff onto DV tapes, but you can
use the camera as a pass-through device and get the old stuff
directly onto your computer for editing purposes. I wish someone
had made clear the advantages and importance of inputs when I
bought my DV camcorder. The reviews and magazines I read barely
mentioned this feature - and nobody stressed its importance. But
if you're going to be doing any editing, it is critical (if you
want to work on any of your old stuff). Don't make the same
mistake I did - make SURE you get this feature. It doesn't seem to
impact the price of the cameras; some offer it and some don't."
This advice came not a moment too soon for me. Thank you for
helping us, Frank!

There is a bit of circumstantial evidence - apparently some MT

ZDNET DELIVERS Price-Feature AnalysisVol 1, No. 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This week, we present a special shopper report featuring
four cool products. We have reviewed these products,
compared each to five products with similar features,
and analyzed the range of prices for each category. What
you'll see is a shopper tool we've dubbed the "Price-Feature
Ratio Analysis." Featured products can fall in to three
stages of Price-Feature ratios:

Stage 1: High Price-Feature Ratio - Technophiles will rush
to buy the product, but can expect to pay higher prices
for the honor of being the first among their friends to have one.

Stage 2: Variable Price-Feature Ratio - Expect high variability
in prices among products with similar features. It pays to
comparison shop for the best price.

Stage 3: Low Price-Feature Ratio - When compared to products
with similar features, prices are low and don't vary much
from merchant to merchant. Use our merchant ratings to
find the right one for you.

We have rated each of the products featured in this supplement
to aid your shopping experience.

Hollywood & Silicon Valley: A way out?
The controversy over digital file swapping is no closer to an amicable resolution than it was when peer-to-peer technology first came into vogue.

Charlie Cooper, Executive Editor/Commentary

Just desserts for scofflaws

U.S. Rep. Howard L. Berman weighed in this week, arguing that piracy over P2P networks robs songwriters on a massive scale. The congressman from Hollywood has authored a bill to stop illegal digital downloads by giving copyright owners the ability to technologically impair the distribution of copyrighted works.

Read Full Story

Spotting a scam in sheep's clothing

Berman's proposal received a cool reception in Silicon Valley, where rules are frowned upon and unfettered innovation reigns supreme. So it was that StreamCast CEO Steve Griffin spoke for many in the community when he wrote that Berman's proposal won't work. What's more, he wondered, was Berman really concerned about controlling piracy, or could the congressman from Hollywood be influenced by certain constituents? Conspiracy buffs this week had a field day.

How to curb digital piracy

The odds that either side will raise the white flag are slim. But must this debate necessarily turn into an endless donnybrook? Former White House staffer Jonathan Greenblatt doesn't buy into historical determinism, and believes Hollywood can respond to the challenge of new media. First, it must shy away from any legislation that aims to control technology or enforces any "draconian" digital rights management rules. What other suggestions does he offer? Read on.

Writing file sharing's final chapter

All this occurs as the P2P community lost one of its brighter lights. Computer scientist and entrepreneur Gene Kan died June 29. Kan, who helped to develop an early open-source version of Gnutella software, wrote a column for CNET News.com on June 21, drawing on the lessons learned from the history of peer-to-peer technology. In this highly nuanced piece, Kan offers a timely warning about what can happen when people get overly excited about new technologies.

CEOs: Are you too focused?

Conventional wisdom has it that "focus" is de rigueur for any corporation hoping to achieve superior performance. The flip side of this argument is that markets are quick to discount the valuations of diversified companies because of perceived shortcomings. But researchers at McKinsey offer an alternative idea, suggesting that there's a particularly fertile middle ground between focus and diversification.

Folks,

my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.

Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.

I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?

Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.

If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.

Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions
welcome.

Thanks a lot,
Peter

Just got this ... I was just reading mail, but in a very dark

the (laptop) screen. I think I put my fingers on the wrong keys.
(I mostly use the keyboard exclusively while running exmh).

This is from today's cvs (the fixes for the problems I mentioned
yesterday are included) - I eventually managed to contact the cvs
server.

ps: I have the sequences window vertical instead of horizontal, and the
"colours from the ftoc" stuff all deleted, and it is looking just about as
good as the old unseen window used to look. I still have some work to
do to make it a little nicer (listboxes seem to have some strange habits)
and then I need to make it all optional and parameterized, at the minute
I'm just embedding stuff in the code, much quicker for prototyping. Once
its done, I'll send a patch for someone to look over.

I am wondering whether there's a way that I can use sitescooper and/or plucker
or some other free utility to convert word documents into something a bit
more palmos friendly?

I don't have a Windows machine, so it becomes problematic to convert them;
I know that if this were not the case, in Word I could save them as some
other more friendly format.

Thats where the gentic Purists bredding program was heading. Hitler wet
himslef when his big brains laid out the plan of forced natural selection,
images of strong young blonde boys marching around him sent him off in a
double nostil coke blow frenzy..

Of course back then they did not have the fine tuned maps we got today.
Macromap wise we got the host of gps angles over head beaming the answeres
in feet to our "where are we now" musings, micromap wise we now have the
ability to spot the "will laugh at the goon shows" switch"

All the early genticpurists had to go on was hkull size, hair color and
schlongalongadingdangage.

AS always the probelm is not that we can do this , its what we do with it.

Well it looks pretty much 99% sure that we will be moving in on Nov 1 to
the new house. I think the only thing that stops us now are acts of
dieties and total economic collapse..so no one mention the dow for the
next few weeks..

In preperation we drove to Best Buy tonight and picked up the test core
for the wifi net. I got a linksys BEFW11S4(1) for the router/hub/wireless
ap/firewall/etc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptop

I made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up the
card, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire ether
hub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the
webinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features some
more (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)
but all in all a smooth move.

Now the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots of
funky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in ,
essentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions get
goofy inside the pit. That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet between
the AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting
11mbs and at least 60% goodness.

Some cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal works
inthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have a
microwave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bear
cat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a bad
thing? Ben or heather, if you read this years from now...well by then I
hope youare better at countermoeasures:)- )

Ok, enough testing for tonight. I gota say, being able to do this in bed
by vncing via wifi to my desktop is a blast...oh no...wifes pillow is
heading this way....DUCKKKKK

Techs gain on Intel, Motorola news
Although computer chip titan Intel posted lower-than-expected earnings, its upbeat forecast helped lift technology shares Wednesday.

Also boosting the sector was Motorola, which beat expectations for operating earnings and predicted a net profit in the last two quarters of the year. CNET's Tech index rose 14.46 points, or 1.41 percent, to 1,007.37, and the tech-laced Nasdaq composite index tacked on 21.97 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,397.23.

With aircraft maker Boeing beating the consensus Wall Street earnings estimate, the Dow Jones industrials increased 69.37 points, or 0.82 percent, to 8,542.48. The S&P 500 rose 5.08 points, or 0.56 percent, to 906.02.

Motorola Sees Profit Rebound
CHICAGO - Wireless technology giant Motorola Inc. on Wednesday said it expects to bounce back to a net profit in the third and fourth quarters helped by aggressive cost cutting.

Motorola, a day after posting the largest quarterly loss in its history, said it expects to achieve earnings of about 2 cents a share in the third quarter and 10 cents in the fourth quarter. The estimated earnings for the second half of the year includes charges of about $215 million related to previously announced restructuring actions.

The world's second largest mobile phone maker has slashed its work force by more than a third from its peak of 150,000 in August 2000. It said last month it would cut another 7,000 jobs, bringing employment to 93,000 by mid-2003.

MOTOROLA, INC 15.15 4.27%

Apple meets lowered expectations
Apple Computer on Tuesday reported quarterly sales and earnings that matched analysts' lowered expectations as flat-panel iMac sales and sales to schools fell short of the company's initial hopes.
The company earned $32 million, or 9 cents per share, on revenue of $1.43 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, Apple earned $61 million, or 17 cents per share, on revenue of $1.48 billion

Analysts expected Apple to report earnings of 9 cents per share, according to First Call. Apple warned last month that sales would be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, down from an earlier estimate of $1.6 billion. The company said it expected earnings to be between 8 and 10 cents per share.

APPLE COMPUTER INC 15.63 -12.49%

HP, EMC storage systems to work better together
SAN FRANCISCO - Hewlett-Packard Co. and EMC Corp. said on Wednesday that they were opening up technology to each other in order to maker their storage systems work better together.

However, the deal will not include technology from Hitachi Data Systems, which makes the hardware for HP's high-end storage system, an HP spokesman said.

The deal follows close cooperation between storage heavyweight EMC and Compaq Computer Corp., which was acquired by HP in May.

HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 13.57 -4.84%

Investec Inc. stays bullish on Intel in report 7/17/02
Analysts Eric Ross and Sam Chang reiterate a "strong buy" rating on the computer chip giant after it reports second-quarter earnings below the consensus Wall Street estimate. Ross and Chang expect a modest seasonal increase in demand in the second half of this year, with strength in consumer laptop buying. Calling Intel the premier semiconductor firm, they suggest the stock is a bargain.

AT&T names Dorman chairman, succeeding Armstrong
NEW YORK - AT&T Corp. said on Wednesday its president, David Dorman, will succeed C. Michael Armstrong as chairman and chief executive officer when the nation's largest telephone company sells its cable-television business to Comcast Corp.

Dorman's appointment, which was widely expected, will become effective once the sale of AT&T Broadband closes later this year.

My take: if genetic engineering includes selective breeding, then it
also includes human pairs that are not randomly grouped.

It doesn't matter if those two intend what they are doing, they are
engaged in a 'selected sort'. It has been brought up that a boss no
longer marries his secretary. Now the female law partner selects
another high earning mate (at least associate law). So instead of two
couples making $140K a piece (100K + 40K) you have one pair with $200
and one pair with $80 and this has some interesting social effects. And
one of those effects is the difference in their children (on average).

I don't think a ballistic missile defense system will be much help
against a rock a couple thousand kilometers in diameter. That's WAY
outside the design spec for any such system. Particularly when
ballistic intercept designs usually don't have any type of warhead
associated with them, either being kinetic or directed energy weapons.

Contrary to popular belief, ballistic missile defense isn't a hard
problem (ignoring whether or not it is useful). The only real challenge
is materials science, as it really pushes the envelope of materials
performance requirements to places they've never been; there has been
some technology crossover with some of the new materials and processes
they've had to come up with. The actual discrimination algorithms,
while way more advanced than anything you'll see in the private sector
(and classified, to keep it that way), are usually run on a crusty old
MIPS R3k embedded processor or similar, with a low-to-mid range DSP to
help out. It is not computationally intensive by any means.

I used to be tangentially involved in various ballistic missile
intercept weapon programs many years ago and am pretty familiar with the
technologies that go into them. Most of the arguments against it from a
technological standpoint are ignorant bullshit, and have lead me to
believe that hardly anyone understands the technical parameters of
ballistic missile intercept. And the arguments that are made without
reference to the capability of the technology are neither particularly
convincing nor conclusive.

In summary:

1) Ballistic missile intercept technology is useless on a big rock. You
are much better off using heavy-lift space technology to deliver a big
nuke (or small nuke, depending on your plan).

2) State-of-the-art ballistic missile intercept technology is far more
competent than most people imagine it is, and has discrimination
capabilities that exceed most popular belief. It better be -- they've
had twenty years to work on it.

3) I've never heard a really convincing argument against deploying
ballistic missile intercept technology, particularly considering most of
the R&D investment has already been made. I don't really care about it
one way or the other, but I also don't see why other people have fits
over it either.

What does it matter that they were selecting to produce their own

That doesn't matter. What does matter
is that they were going on phenotypes,
and didn't engineer the genetics. That
example makes a good case for natural
selection, but not for artificial.

(do "married people live longer" because
of the benefits of matrimony, or because
acceptable health is one of the qualities
selected for in spouses?)

Of course, if there are FoRKs with six
or fewer biological great grandparents
(or who are offspring of Wilt) I should
eat my words; otherwise, the micro/macro
distinction seems much more relevant.

-Dave

I guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing
against any checks on genetic engineering use that same argument -
"we've been doing it since prehistory, so we don't need to apply any
caution today".

One can also view that argument as a case
for checks: livestock owners have, over a
period of millenia, altered the genetics
of their herds to be dumber, meatier, and
more tolerant of industrial living, so if
caution is in order, they are some of the
least likely people to volunteer it.

draw the pain

"Ken never wrote about this method, but he often demonstrated it in
workshops. Let us say you have a physical pain somewhere in your body. You
draw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Take
about 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefully
listening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurts
and where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes of
this the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is to
imagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay."

Works! There's this coworker - a real pain in my ass! I used my middle
finger to trace his outline for about 60 seconds. I listened to him, found
the boundary, and repeated the motion. He left my office!

irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and
contrast with our (my) modern mental models.

We create the world we live in.
A loving person lives in a loving world,

Everyone you meet is your mirror.

You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence
as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to
waste what you do have.

The past is dead,
The future is imaginary,
Happiness can only be

How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the
direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.

Love a person because he or she is there.
This is the only reason.

Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions

With enough warning, you might not even care about trying to divert
the meteor -- you'd divert the Earth instead.

I recall reading many years ago about calculations, done separately
both by US and USSR scientists for different reasons, about the
effect of nuclear explosions on the moon's mass, and thus its orbit,
and thus also (over time) the Earth's path around the sun.

I believe the conclusion was that mild changes in the moon's
composition would have the effect, over several years, of changing
significantly where the Earth would be at any certain future point.

Voila! No collision -- at least not with the initial threat. And
no need to travel out to anywhere near the meteor, either. Just
the moon.

CNET Virus & Security Newsletter

July 17, 2002

--Robert VamosiSenior Associate EditorCNET Software and Internet Services

Dear Readers,
So far, 2002 has been a year marked with variations on earlier
worms. If you update your antivirus software on a regular basis,
these new versions of Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance.
But if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the
continuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate you. In security
news, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could affect
Outlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.

Frethem.k worm wants to give you a password
An e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with
a password is yet another variant from the pesky Frethem worm
family. Frethem.k, technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also
called Frethem.l by some vendors, uses its own SMTP engine to
send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. This
worm does not carry a destructive payload. Mac and Linux users
are not affected.

Yaha.e screensaver worm spreading
The Yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly
screensaver, proving that users worldwide are still opening
attached files from total strangers. Yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also
known as Lentin.e, Yaha.f, and Yaha.g) is a successful variant of
a worm first seen around Valentine's Day this year. Thankfully,
this worm does not affect Mac, Linux, or Unix users.

Leaky PGP Outlook plug-in
PGP 7.03 and 7.04, widely used plug-ins for Microsoft's Outlook
e-mail client, inadvertently weakens security and leaves the mail
program open to attack. Fortunately, there is a patch available.

Are Web-based e-mail accounts less virus-prone than Outlook?
Is it true that if I use a Web-based e-mail service such as
Yahoo I'll be safe from Outlook-related viruses? --Charles M.

No. Many new viruses do not require a PC-based e-mail client such
as Outlook in order to spread. These new viruses, including
Klez, have their own e-mail client (SMTP) and can find e-mail
addresses within cached Web pages on an infected machine,
bypassing the need to use Outlook's Address Book. Larger
Web-based e-mail services, such as Hotmail and Yahoo Mail, screen
mail hosted on their sites for viruses, but there's no beating
having a good antivirus product on your desktop just in case.

Yeah, right. Considering the Genesis project just won an award for
figuring out (surprise, surprise) that N-body problems with 10+ bodies
yield some interesting synergetic surprises ... suffice it to say
that the issue has been hashed over in sci.astro many, many times,
since even long before Hollywood posed the problem, and the very best
advice is still "duck and cover"; if you are still going to nudge
anything, though, I'd nudge the rock (the one the size of a small
town) as you're less likely to re-define global agriculture that way.

'Course, you're gonna have this problem of distributing the force over
a large enough surface area that it translates into a resillient
compression wave instead of a knifeblade/diamond faultline split.
It's also not a game of billiards, but a 6+ dimensional collision
problem (space, time, spin, temp, maybe electromag too if there's any
heavy metals in it, and there often is) complete with relativistic
effects and everything. Hands up all those with experience subjecting
blackboxed alien geology to sustained forces in excess of 100 megatons
(10% of it's own momentum). I'm going to trust the US Army with this
when they can't even /find/ more than a few hundred Al Queda in a
desert?

Oh, another problem: It's not the only rock out there. We're just
getting better at spotting them.

Tell ya what: when you cowboys do get ready to bally-hootin' out to

It is much more interesting whether you can kill enough of delta v for a

well could invest that effort into a launch capacity on the Moon.

A bull market climbs a wall of worry -- on record volume.

Yeah, I know, it's different this time. Pay no attention to the bear
behind the curtain, and all that.

However, at the end of the *last* bear market, in 1983 -- yup, that
long ago -- Granville sell-orders caused bloodbaths with boring
regularity, a stockholm-syndrome economy had recently been delivered
of Keynesian monetary apparatchiks at the Fed and elsewhere, and
Henry "Dr. Doom" Kauffman opined offhand that interest rates *might*
come down finally... and pop! went the market, sending the NYSE
volume through the roof. (Record volume then was around a hundred
mill. Yesterday, ladies and germs, it was upward of 2 point something
*billion* shares).. Back then, I was a mail-cart-pushing,
key-punching "administration" clerk at Morgan Stanley in Chicago,
chief scrounge for a bunch of Masters of the Universe, and everybody
at Morgan thought the resulting price-pop was just a technical rally
and wouldn't last either. :-). Six months later, people *still* said
it wouldn't last, and a girlfriend's uncle was saying that it was too
late, he'd missed the train, so he was going to stay out 'till the
market came back down a bit. By that time, the Dow was at, what,
1600? I wonder if he's still out, waiting...

A 40% decline is a big chunk of change, boys and girls, even if it's
40% of a bubble. Actually, by my count, it's 100% of the bubble, but
that's just me. After all, Amazon and EBay's P/Es still need a
pressurized cabin to breathe in.

So, yes, the market may go lower, but not much more, relatively
speaking. At some point, and fairly soon, I bet, someone's going to
realize that, even though you wouldn't want to actually trade one for
a house, tulips are still nice things to have around.

Hint: Interest rates are rediculuously low, they aren't going up any
time soon, and, if we can survive the election, the recently-started
CEO witch-hunt won't be too much more than Street theater, probably
not resulting in much in the way of regulation or legislation. The
threat of which, frankly, probably caused this recent explosive
decompression in the first place. Your tax dollars at work, if you
will.

So, in light of the erstwhile bloodbath on Capital Hill, and the real
one we just saw a few days ago in the market, it may be time for
people to remember what Mr. Rothschild said, and buy now while
there's blood in the streets.

As to whether the accounting is "rigged", remember what Robert
Heinlein said: "Who cares if the game is rigged? You can't win if you
don't play."

Cheers,
RAH
The aforementioned girlfriend, by the way, traded *me* in for an
actual Rothschild in 1984, after I insisted on going back to school
and talking my way into the back door at the University of Chicago to
boot. The cost of anything being the foregone alternative, it
sometimes seems to me I'm *still* paying for that detour, but that's
a bear of a different color, and it's okay as long as I don't look
behind the curtain, right? :-).

... nor what color your passport?

More American exceptionalism:

"The United States is the only country in the world to tax its citizens
on a worldwide basis, irrespective of whether they spend time in the
country or whether they have assets there," said Philip Marcovici,
a Zurich-based lawyer with international law firm Baker and Mackenzie.

and perhaps even irrespective of their
current citizenship:

Under current expatriation law, there are wealth thresholds based on
net worth which lead to a presumption that a person giving up U.S.
citizenship is doing so for tax reasons.

Individuals who have given up their citizenship and who have earned
$100,000 in any one of the 10 years before expatriation, or who have a
net worth exceeding $500,000, would automatically be deemed a so-called
"taxpatriate." Those persons would be subject to ordinary income tax
on U.S. source income for 10 years. They would also be subject to
U.S. estate and gift tax during the 10-year period.

I suppose it could be much worse;
there could be some twee affinity
program for US citizenship, and a
bank of phone people who only get
paid well if they manage to keep
one from cancelling membership...

Last month, Congress proposed a new exit tax on all citizens who give up
their U.S. status. If the proposal becomes law, individuals will be taxed
as if they had either sold everything or died. This would give rise to
immediate exposure to capital gains tax.

To be fair, would this mean that they'd
also immediately pay out the difference
for anyone whose tax basis was greater
than current estate value?

Eugen Leitl writes:
Apart from twiddling with the surface albedo which might be not
enough -- we currently don't have ion drives with enough power, or at
least we can't develop and deploy them on time,

My estimate is that, in the worst case, we have 17 years (5.4e8
seconds) to move it one earth radius, or about 6000 km (6e6 m).
a t^2/2 = x, if I remember right, so a = 2x/t^2, which is
1.2e7 m/(2.9e17 s^2), or about 4.1e-11 m/s^2, which is not a very
large acceleration, roughly equivalent to the gravitational
acceleration in these parts divided by 200000000000. Assuming a
2km-wide --- that is, 20 000 decimeter-wide --- spherical asteroid of
specific gravity 10, 4/3 pi r^3 says it would have a volume of 4e12
cubic decimeters and thus a mass of 4e13 kg. The force we'd have to
apply to achieve this acceleration would be roughly equivalent to the
weight of 200 kg here on Earth.

So, yeah, ion drives are probably a no-go, unless I screwed up the
calculations here; I think the force they typically exert is about
four orders of magnitude too small.

If we just wanted to hit today it with enough of an impulse that it
would miss us 17 years later, we'd need to accelerate it by about 1.1
cm/s. A one-ton (1000kg) mass would need to hit it at about 4e9 m/s,
or about ten times the speed of light, to achieve this, so that's not
possible. (If you could actually put enough work into a one-ton mass,
as it approached the speed of light, it would mass more, so you could
still do it with a one-ton mass; but we don't have anything
approaching that speed.) The impulse required is inversely
proportional to the remaining time to impact, so if we were to hit it
after half the time has elapsed, we'd need to accelerate it by around
2.2 cm/s instead.

The gravitational force of an Earth-sized mass could provide
sufficient deflection if that mass were about 4.5e5 times as far away
from the asteroid as we are from Earth's center, or about 2.7e9 m, or
about 0.018 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun (0.018 AU).
(And if that mass stayed so nearby for 17 years.)

The effects of continuous acceleration benefit greatly from planning
ahead, since they scale with t^2, not t --- and thus the needed
acceleration scales with 1/t^2. After half the time has elapsed, we'd
need four times as much acceleration to make it miss the Earth than if
we were to start accelerating it now.

All of these numbers are a little low, because the Earth presents a
slightly easier target than its physical size suggests, due to its
gravity well. How much easier depends on the speed of the projectile
in ways I don't understand.

They're also a little high, because they assume the force is being
applied purely at right angles to the asteroid's current path, which
is a slightly suboptimal scenario (although for velocity changes five
orders of magnitude smaller than the relative velocity, the difference
is probably insignificant.) And they assume there are no other effects on the asteroid's path.

What about electrical charges? Could we electrically charge the
asteroid and another nearby asteroid, perhaps with electron beams, to
provide the needed acceleration?

Of course, all of this calculation could be applied in the other
direction, too. If you want to sock a moon colony with a one-ton
asteroid, you could do it with a tiny amount of force applied over
twenty-five years to adjust its orbit.

Don't know much about eRoom - but there is the magic phrase 'collaborate in

actually /benefit/ from collaborating in real-time.

http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/INW20021004S0001

Content-management vendor Documentum said late Thursday it plans to acquire
privately held e-Room Technologies in a deal worth about $100 million.

Documentum will issue approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock
and pay about $12.6 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of
eRoom.

Documentum makes a platform for enterprise-wide content management. ERoom
makes tools for enterprise collaboration. Its customers include Airbus,
Bausch & Lomb, Ford Motor Co., and Sony.

Documentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new Collaboration
Edition of its content-management suite. ERoom was already integrating its
tools to the Documentum platform, making an acquisition an easy target,
according to Documentum president and CEO Dave DeWalt.

With the upcoming joint product, customers will be able to collaborate in
real-time via virtual workspaces, sharing schedules, resources, and even
jointly creating content.

Content creation and management has always been a collaborative task, but
workflow has usually been delivered via a Web browser interface or even
simple e-mail -- and rarely in real-time.

For now, Documentum will sell the eRoom platform and its own
content-management system through combined sales channels. Further
integration is planned down the line, the companies said.

However, the signs do seem to head for a much deeper crapper than the one

better by breaking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA)
during a live presentation on Friday.

Fresh from giving RealNetworks a slating for not completely
backing open source with its latest announcement, Perens said that
during a Digital Rights Management presentation to be held Friday
at the O'Reilly developer conference in San Diego, he would break
the law.

The DMCA has been a sore point in the open source community since
the outlawing of DeCSS, a tool created so that DVDs could be
played on Linux machines, and more recently since the arrest of
Dmitry Sklyarov and the criminal charges faced by his employer,
Elcomsoft.

Based on the recent history of DMCA contravention, Perens could
face imprisonment or a $500,000 fine for his actions.

According to Infoworld the demonstration is to be carried out in
protest at the regional system used by the motion picture industry
to prevent DVDs released in one country being played on machines
in another country.

During his presentation, Perens will demonstrate how to hack a DVD
player so that it can play movies from any region.

"It is a political and social statement, and the statement is that
the people do not need to have a hall monitor living in their
stereo system and should be able to play any kind of media on the
device they wish," he was quoted as saying.

But luck may be on his side, if last year is anything to go by. At
the same conference in 2001 Perens made a presentation on the
triviality of Digital Rights Management systems using exactly the
same slides that got Sklyarov arrested.

Content-management vendor Documentum said late Thursday it plans to
acquire
privately held e-Room Technologies in a deal worth about $100 million.

Documentum will issue approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock
and pay about $12.6 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of
eRoom.

Documentum makes a platform for enterprise-wide content management. ERoom
makes tools for enterprise collaboration. Its customers include Airbus,
Bausch & Lomb, Ford Motor Co., and Sony.

Documentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new Collaboration
Edition of its content-management suite. ERoom was already integrating its
tools to the Documentum platform, making an acquisition an easy target,
according to Documentum president and CEO Dave DeWalt.

With the upcoming joint product, customers will be able to collaborate in
real-time via virtual workspaces, sharing schedules, resources, and even
jointly creating content.

Content creation and management has always been a collaborative task, but
workflow has usually been delivered via a Web browser interface or even
simple e-mail -- and rarely in real-time.

For now, Documentum will sell the eRoom platform and its own
content-management system through combined sales channels. Further
integration is planned down the line, the companies said.

(Not there yet in Mozilla and therefore not in the new mail engine I
presume?)

Netscape Messenger/Mozilla have LDAP LDIF import/export, but I can't
find vCard or a reference to it anywhere. I like the Netscape/Mozilla
email client. I avoid LookOut for at least two reasons: Windows Only
(my main environment is Linux with 30% on Windows) and security issues.

Now that LDAP, and the related DSML and DNS SRV record methods, are
becoming more popular, is there a decline of vCard?
Is there a standard emerging to deal with the mismatch in naming between
the two?

I've brushed with directories in the past, but I'm getting in deep along

Cheers, Adam.

Perhaps people are starting to notice how profit motive drains the
meaning out of their lives. Kinda sucks to be an ant farming for the
corporate lords. Funny how most of the rest of the world is more and
more apprehensive towards American Democracy.

I just went to DC for the first time. I was awestruck by the
monuments, the words of Thomas Jefferson, the Spirit of Democracy set
in stone. Amazing to think that in little more than 200 years our
government could be so far removed from those honorable principles.
Adam Smith presumed that the marketplace would regulate itself
through morality, good faith, and responsibility. Corporate America
seems to feel that those principles stand in the way of making the
real bucks. How much more can they co-opt and commodify? Get your
copyrights in quick so you can hold on to your piece of the pie.
Health care, public programs, pensions, social security - these are
now regarded as worthless unless they can turn a profit.

Ah, socialized medicine. Siestas. 6 week vacation leave. I hear Spain

The alternative hypothesis is that its due to novelty, and then of

Has anyone considered the fact that these occurrances appear to
be increasing. I'm aware that maybe more publicity surrounding
some and certain agencies have been granted more funding, but
I'd like to see some data which shows if these are increasing
or not.

Why? Well, it seems to me if we were going to get hit, the one
that does it may have been part of a larger swarm or cluster
which has over the years increased the distance between the
rocks. Like the Schumaker Levy-9, which had multiple rocks
all impacting at different times, others may have this same
type of design and could be in different stages of increasing
distance from one another. Also to consider is if SL-9 was
on course for earth, would we get hit by all rocks or only
one because the earth is a much smaller target than Jupiter?

So, my theory is that if these near earth rocks are increasing
so does our chance of discovering the last three were part of
a swarm of 15 of which 10, 11 and 12 may hit.

programming languages are defended on the basis of analogies with structural engineering, as presented in
Billington's The Tower and the Bridge.

The Value of Analogies

Programming language design is a comparatively new activity - it has existed for less than half a century, so
it is
often worthwhile to look to older design disciplines to understand better this new activity. Thus, my book
Principles of Programming Languages: Design, Evaluation, and Implementation, grew out of a study of teaching
methods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design.
Perhaps you
have also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (FORTRAN = Model T, C = dune
buggy, etc.).

These analogies can be very informative, and can serve as ``intuition pumps'' to enhance our creativity, but
they
cannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions must
be
based on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative.

In this essay I'll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but I will base my remarks
on a
book about structural engineering, The Tower and the Bridge, by David P. Billington. Although there are many
differences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transfer
rather
directly.

According to Billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call
``the
three E's'': Efficiency, Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology,
which
Billington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three S's). We will consider each in
turn.

Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used

In structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safety
and the
issues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). Similarly, in programming language
design,
efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples where
efficiency
considerations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming
Languages). In the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing
time, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized was
programmer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN's
implicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed
for the
sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking).

Efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we
are
not comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as
programmer time. Similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are
reduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now
turn.

Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost

Whereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. In structural engineering, economy seeks
to
maximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges
are
usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design, the ``public''
that
must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these
programmers work.

Economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example,
the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost
of
computer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the
increasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of
program
maintenance compared to program development.

Other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether major
manufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some
way
by influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense), whether it has been standardized, whether
it
comes to be perceived as a ``real'' language (used by ``real programmers'') or as a ``toy'' language (used by
novices
or dilettantes), and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles, social factors are
frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming
language.

Often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are
often
unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also, many social issues, from
dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately
represented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost'' and ``benefit'' must be considered
in
seeking an economical design.

Elegance Symbolizes Good Design

``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?'' snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but Billington shows clearly the
critical
role of elegance in ``hard-nosed'' engineering.

For the Designer

It is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the
difficulty
of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples).
Structural
engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but Billington observes that the best designers don't
make
extensive use of computer models and calculation.

One reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about which
variables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this
decision is not
made well. Also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this
is
another potential source of error. Because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical
analysis
may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price of
safety is
additional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy).

Similarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a
choice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an
over-engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical.

Many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; it
vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design.
Billington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a
consequence of
an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However, the very problem that destroyed
the
Tacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided
by aesthetic principles.

According to Billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do
not
abandon it altogether). Rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is because
solutions to
structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible
solutions to a
particular problem, such as bridging a particular river. Therefore, expert designers restrict their attention
to
designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces are
unbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable.

The general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can
be
guided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this idea
by
inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. He adds
(p.
21), ``When the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.'' In other words, the choice of
form is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and
economical design). If we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design.

The same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which the
interaction
of features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let our
aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having
to
check all the possible interactions.

For the User

In this case, what's good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge
that
looks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which
features may ``explode'' if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well-designed
bridge
gives us confidence when we cross it. So also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should
reinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in the
consequences
of our actions.

We accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable to
sustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won't much matter that it was beautiful on the
outside.
So also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation
of a
deep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their
(unwarranted)
confidence.

In summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As a
consequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or
programming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited
value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize the
preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages:
The Elegance Principle

Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good.

The Programming Language as Work Environment

There are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programming
language is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortable
and
safe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that
take
place within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop?

A programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer's
fatigue
and frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator,
encouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines'' and work as a
natural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine'' by encouraging
the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programming
language should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs.

Through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example, in the variety of
its features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may
represent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programming
language can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; by
neglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention.
Out of
sight, out of mind.

Acquiring a Sense of Elegance

Aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined
sense
of elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive
experience
in design, which, especially in Europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers.
Because of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each
competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The public
also
critiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along
with that of the designers.

So also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively -
and criticize, revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people's designs
and try
to improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing''
comes
along.

"Yes, and Eliza and I composed a precocious critique of the Constitution
of the United States of America, too. We argued that it was as good a
scheme for misery as any, since its success in keeping the common people
reasonably happy and proud depended on the strength of the people
themselves - and yet it described no practical machinery which would tend
to make the people, as opposed to their elected representatives, strong.
We said it was possible that the framers of the Constitution were
blind to the beauty of persons who were without great wealth or powerful
friends or public office, but who were nonetheless genuinely strong.
We thought it was more likely, though, that the framers had not
noticed that it was natural, and therefore almost inevitable, that human
beings in extraordinary and enduring situations should think of themselves
as composing new families. Eliza and I pointed out that this happened no
less in democracies than in tyrannies, since human beings were the same
the wide world over, and civilized only yesterday.
Elected representatives, hence, could be expected to become members of
the famous and powerful family of elected representatives - which would,
perfectly naturally, make them wary and squeamish and stingy with respect
to all the other sorts of families which, again, perfectly naturally,
subdivided mankind.
Eliza and I, thinking as halves of a single genius, proposed that the
Constitution be amended so as to guarantee that every citizen, no matter
how humble or crazy or incompetent or deformed, somehow be given
membership in some family as covertly xenophobic and crafty as the one
their public servants formed.
Good for Eliza and me!

I propose they rename it "Charlie Heston High" and maybe the students

the suburbs of Washington. That's far more effectual than blowing
oneself up in a bus.

In America these days, it seems that violence ascribed to any political
doctrine foreign to Bushism is vile and repugnant. But random violence
is entertainment and intrigue.

A couple of ex-FBI "consultants" speaking on the shootings in DC were
quoted as saying the shooters, presumed to be a pair, were getting a
"heroin-like high" from each successful kill and that they "for
whatever reason decided to level the playing field, thumbing their nose
at law enforcement and society."

To actually answer the question, each of the last three reports was
hurling down a different "tube" so, no, they are not related, but yes,
each tube contains an uneven distribution of stuff that only /peaks/
near the biggest chunks. It would actually be pretty amazing to find
any repeat visitor still in one piece after it's solar perigee. Space
in that neighbourhood is warped like a cheese-grater. We can expect
one (or more) really big mother(s), surrounded by lots of cute little
'uns smeared out in the crest of its gravity wave.

Another curious artifact of the old-and-periodic rock data is the
bigger rocks are on the outer edge of the tubes: Relativistic effects
on the redshift/blueshift of the particle solar heating differential
on either side of each bit slow the smaller less-massive (and more
easily pushed) particles dropping them into lower orbits ... or at
least, that's our best theory.

I've seen data that shows 1200 rocks (TV-set sized and smaller)
crashing into the Ottawa skies /every/ /single/ /night/, and that's
just the background noise. Plots of that data show us passing through
hundreds of 'tubes' of debris, each indicative of some other larger
something out there, only a small handful of which have been
discovered. This is without even considering the one's headed this
way out of the Oort for their First Big Trip.

One thing you will just have to get used to is hearing news of a
possible collision; we have only started funding the projects to look
for these things since Hollywood took an interest with Armageddon, and
we have only just recently turned on a bunch of new toys to do
automated sky surveys. There are also some new (and very clever)
amateur projects co-ordinating multiple telescopes to detect these
criters, one of which plans to network dozens of ground based machines
around the world. You may remember a few years back the 2028 doomsday
story -- consider them good ghost stories, then go back to work.

20,000 years ago, one of them the size of Mt Everest just ever so
slightly grazed us and left a scar 400km long in the side of South
America before it scooted out into space. First nations people would
have been there then, and it would have seriously ruined their day.
Orbital elements tell us that our modern technology would have perhaps
given us 90-min advance warning.

The near-miss earlier this month wasn't seen until it was already past
us; we can't detect rocks on their trip behind the Sun, and when they
come out slingshot to relativistic speeds, well, it's just too darn
late to do much of anything about it. On the inbound trip, even at
their max full-moon angle, these things are most often magnitude 16 or
way worse, which is many magnitudes fainter than what you see in the
deepest dark-skies; no one thought to paint them shiny and white.
They day before it "hits" my software says NT7 will be magnitude 14 --
it's easier to see the space station.

What's worse, the Sun is not a smooth hard spheric marble, it's a
twisted gelatinous hunk o' hunk o' burnin' love, so the precise warp
curve of space right near it's backside is (ahem) somewhat problematic
to compute precisely. It's also spewing considerable plasma flux in
all directions, and then there's all these other big gelatinous roaming
globs (Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune) and some significant roaming
rubble (us), and damn it, they are all spinning too, and most of them
have a magnetosphere!

Shit. Forget it.

Learn to play the banjo. Take peppermint Rye-Kee Shee-At-Zoo relaxation
therapy and oodles of Ag-nasial I&I-drop suppliments, eat no kind of
frozen portion, and floss. Good planets are real hard to find, so
enjoy the one you got while it's here. Call your ma. Do an anonymous
kindness for your better half, another for a total stranger. Having
all the best toys is useless when they all spontaneously combust from
a global Wormwood shockwave. You should be diggin' it while it's
happenin'

Like, just live your life like there's no tomorrow, ok? Don't bank on
being able to redeem yourself later. Yeah, sure, Osama could whack you
with some nail-coated fuel-air bombs, heck a mis-informed TopGun could
do it too, but the Good Lord could do it too, with pure, clean and
galactically EnviroFriendly kinetic energy, and He don't stand in line
for no Airport Security Check. Hell, fire and brimstone are
classically given in the reverse order; best to be on the impact side
of the planet.

Learn to stop worrying and love the Rock. Besides, the rats and
cockroaches will survive, and they already know how to kickstart
evolution right back into Enrons, WorldComs and Calcuttas. They even
have all our wiring and plumbing diagrams and half of our socks.

Are we going to get hit? Yup.

When? Every 65 million years and, oh my lord, will you /look/ at the time!

Where/what/when? Space is pretty big. Take the largest thing you can
imagine, double it, and add 10%: That is just the local pancake region
between us and the Sun. There's the whole rest of the disk of the
ecliptic and, which is where the NT7 observation came from, it has
only recently occurred to the meteor hunters to "look up" (or down);
almost the first shot looking /out/ of the ecliptic disk, and hoo-whee
there's this big sucker on an "11 tries for a dollar" close encounter
of the smack-em-good kind.

This is what I love about astrophysics: we have theories as good as
anyone else (way better than psychology), and we debate and argue and
expound and conference and bellow and blurt about them, but every time
we turn on some new kind of robot sensor device to actually /look/ at
Reality, well she slaps us right in the face and says in her best Mae
West "Guess again, boys" -- no other science gets that chance (ok,
maybe some do) and there is nothing, _nothing_ more worthless than last
semester's astronomy text.

This is a standard trap for people building things from source. It's
generally wise to have a special "build" environment to avoid these
hassles. Most likely you have some library loading path in your env. An
strace of the app will show it:

the-app 2>&1 | grep dude

Personally, I have a script called logbuild whose entire purpose is to
start a shell with a minimal build environment, logged with script. The
prevents this kind of error. Since configure yanks all sorts of ill
documented values from one's environment for use in the build (CC, ARCH,
various LD_* variables) this kind of thing is necessary.

Often the easiest thing is to have a special nonroot account with no .profile
for building stuff.

Also this week, we've got some very handy utilities. First,
there's Chilkat, a cool zip/unzip ActiveX control that you can
add to any language with ActiveX support (which is most major

that takes all the far-flung bits and pieces of your Visual Basic
masterpiece and socks them all away into one executable file
for ease of distribution.

Corporate America seems to feel that those principles stand in the way
of making the real bucks.

No shit, really? Seriously, if you're not all about screwing over the

When a settler goes postal and kills some Palestinians they are treated
as a criminal, not celebrated in word and song.

But you knew that.

When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target
children with a homicide-bomb, they are careful to dip the shrapnel in
rat poison. It helps prevent blood clotting in the victims, you see.

I'm sure all those Jewish homicide-bombers do the same. Oh wait, there
aren't any.

If the Palestinians are driven completely out, either by expulsion or
death, they will have nobody to blame but themselves. That won't stop
them or you from pretending otherwise.

Good question. This was covered in one of the amateur rags, maybe Sky
and Telescope or even Scienterrific American, long before there was any
web to speak of, but you'd think a 400km gash in the Earth would be
pretty easy to find ;) I remember it from an issue perhaps in the very
late 80's or early 90's.

It's interesting to note that NT7 and many other NEO bodies are all on
trajectories that approach the Earth from under the ecliptic, so with
the Earth tilt, South America becomes a pretty good target. In trying
to find you a site through Google, I turned up several different
impact sites in Venezuela and Brazil, with ages ranging from 251M to
70 years, but not the 400km gash from the above story.

The only google refs I found from that period is one in Arizona
(famous impact crater) and another in NM; do wish I had noted the
actual South American /country/ that contains the scar; Venezuela
sticks in my mind but I can't be certain.

No, it's just we've started looking. After we've actually started looking
for deep infrasound (pressure waves) with a network of stations designed
to enforced the nuke test ban treaty we've discovered that pretty big
impacts are the norm. Current infrasound stations can detect
bolides/meteoroids in ~10 T TNT scale, but some 10 kT events are
relatively frequent. A number of people died in the Tunguska event (1908,
10-15 MT), despite it hitting in the middle of nowhere.

http://216.239.39.100/search?q=cache:637JrhGDB5gC:www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/5thMars99/pdf/6081.pdf+bolide+impact+kT+wave&hl=en&ie=UTF-8

In the Earth atmosphere a large number of bright light flashes of energies
in light impulse of about 0.1- 1 kt TNT and higher have been registered by
USA DoD satellites equipped with photoelectric detectors [9-11]. Intense
light impulses are created by impacts of meteoroids disrupted in the
atmosphere (mainly at altitudes of about 30-45 km). Several techniques for
the assessment of meteor- oid's characteristics from the light curves and
heights of peak intensities have been developed [3,12]. Using these
techniques the preatmospheric kinetic energy for Fifth International
Conference on Mars INITIATION OF SANDSTORMS: I.V.Nemtchinov, O.P.Popova,
V.A.Rybakov, V.V.Shuvalov a number of events was determined. The biggest
event is the 1 February 1994 with ini- tial energy as high as 30-40 kt TNT
(or initial mass of about 400 t). The bright flash with light energy of
about 4.5 kt TNT was caused by this meteoroid which deeply penetrated into
the atmosphere (at an angle of 45 degrees and velocity of 24 km/s) and
disintegrated above at altitudes of about 34 km and 21 km [9,12]. Another
famous impact event, the Sikhote-Alin meteor shower (12 February 1947
event), may be compared with the 1 February 1994 event. Initial masses of
these meteoroids are probably the same, as well as the angle of trajectory
inclination, but the initial velocity of the Sikhote-Alin is almost twice
smaller. That caused fragmentation of 1 February 1994 meteoroid at higher
altitudes and probably large fragments constitute a smaller part of the
pre- breakdown mass in contrast to the Sikhote-Alin event. In a rarefied
atmosphere of Mars analogous im- pactors will penetrate into deeper layers
of the atmos- phere.They will disintegrate lower 15 km or even reach the
planet surface, partially in disrupted form. Only the first disruption
would occur if a meteoroid similar to that caused the 1 February 1994 will
enter into the Martian atmosphere. And this body would reach the Mars
surface as a tense swarm of fragments. The meteoroid similar to that
caused the Sikhote-Alin event would hit the surface in a form of large
frag- ments due to its low velocity. They will create crater with the size
similar to that of the undisrupted meteoroid.

I call PacBell/SBC every two or three months about a recurring problem
we have at my house:

We get a phone bill every month for someone who no longer lives at our
house for a phone line which has been disconnected for over three years
and the account balance is (drum roll please) $0.00! Sometimes the
people I talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me
that the phone number doesn't exist. Some people are able to locate the
account but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we
could get a bill sent to us for that account. Some people can locate the
account and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years
and that the amount owed is $0.00 and then they say somthing along the
lines of "Huh?" or "I'm not sure what's going on... Hold please." And
eventually I have similar conversations with their managers and the
account representatives and billing people and their managers and their
managers' managers ad naseum.

The outcome of every phone call is that they'll "look into it" and fix
the problem and I might receive one or two more bills depending on when
it's resolved. So I wait a month or two and send the bills back marked
"Not at this address, please fsck off." and then eventually call them
back and go through the whole process again. Lately I just explain to
the phone jockeys that I know it's not their fault and I'm not mad at
them and it's just not their day because I'm about to give them hell.
Then I give them the opportunity to have me yell at their boss which
they seem all too happy to do.

At least it gives me a positive way to vent my aggressions and it's a
lot cheaper than seeing a therapist.

PlayStation owners win copyright case

Owners of PlayStation consoles who modify their machines to play games
bought overseas have had a win in the Federal Court.

Sony Computer Entertainment has failed in its claim that "chipping" breaks
copyright laws.

Sony launched legal proceedings against a Sydney man, Eddy Stevens, for
allegedly selling pirated games and also providing and installing
modification chips.

PlayStation consoles in Australia are different from those in the US and
Japan because of the different television formats.

The court was told "chipping" allows people to play legitimately bought
overseas games and copies of games, but also pirated games.

The judgement by Federal Court Justice Ronald Sackville says Sony failed
to prove that PlayStation consoles have a copyright protection measure
installed in the first place and therefore could not rule that a mod chip
breaks copyright legislation.

Mr Stevens was found to have infringed trademark rules in relation to the
pirated games he sold a matter which will come before the court again next
month.

They easily spent more than this just getting the materials together.
Why the hell do companies bother to do this crap? I mean, isn't there

the .33, but I sure as hell would have appreciated lower rates in lieu
of being returned pennies.

I'm truly stuck on this though. I don't know whether to frame the

Does .33 even buy anything anymore? Funny bit of it, is I couldn't

Copyright Law Thwarts Open Source Confab Demo
Posted by Dan Gillmor

Bruce Perens was going to demonstrate a modified DVD player at this week's
Open Source gathering in San Diego. He'd planned to show (Infoworld) how a
DVD player with its regional coding disabled could play DVDs with
different regional codes.

Perens was going to do this in violation, he believed, of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, which bans the circumvention of technological
methods to protect copyrighted material from uses the owner doesn't want.
And the possibility of legal trouble led his employer, Hewlett-Packard, to
ask him not to do the demonstration.

HP funds Perens to pursue a variety of free software projects. He was
willing to take the legal risks himself, he told me today, but HP worried
that it would be "a more juicy target," the kind of deep pockets that
might make the entertainment cartel drool. In that context it's
understandable why HP would be concerned, though I wish the company would
take a stand on the right side of this issue.

So while Perens is going to talk about the DMCA's pernicious impact on
things like free software, he's not going to give his demonstration. A
shame, but that's how things are going these days.

I find this all incredibly funny really. Congress _and_ the courts
relaly do need to be considering how laws such as the DMCA are
applied. For the most part, these rules are coming down to whose
friend you happen to be, how nefarious the defendant party is, and how
asleep the judge is behind the case (asleep/self-interested/bought).
Its giving me a real cynical view on being a lawyer, thats for sure.

I'm not sure what you mean by "let's you and him fight", but it is

for 300 years, and that it was only thanks to the distraction of WW I
that the south managed to gain its independence. If you mean
splitting countries upon arbitrary lines and assigning different groups
to opposite sides of the line, it also seems to have not worked in
India/Pakistan.
I suppose Canada, which is supposed to be a "loose confederation" of 2

You could try antiword (http://www.winfield.demon.nl/linux/).
It's consoled based and converts word 6+ docs to text and some images to
postscript and png.

also there's catdoc and wv for Word --> text conversions. actually, wv
consists of wvWare, which as the manpage says "converts word documents
into other formats such as PS, PDF, HTML, LaTeX, DVI, ABW". HTML would
probably be the best format for use with Plucker/SiteScooper, depending
on how good the DOC --> HTML conversion is. i haven't used either in
over a year as AbiWord or OpenOffice work well enough. (prefer AbiWord
for it's light-weight size, but OpenOffice has the better DOC importer.)

don't know which of these are better or worse than the other, but i
figure, "the more the merrier". ;-)

You could also try openoffice and/or abiword if you
have x installed.

AbiWord supports exporting to PalmDoc (.pdb) which is about as
PalmOS-friendly as you can get. never tried/needed it, but it's listed
there in the "Save As" dialog box.

Wine (or CrossOver Office, if you already have it) may support Word
Viewer (free download from Microsoft), but didn't a year or so ago when
i last tried. Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert
Word 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &
paste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only
version of Word that i had. anyways, a little nostalgia.

I don't have a Windows machine, so it becomes problematic to convert them;
I know that if this were not the case, in Word I could save them as some
other more friendly format.

i have a windows (dual-boot) machine, but it only get used by my
significant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw. (is there any
linux gui app that supports cdrecord's multi-session feature?) since
OpenOffice, i've been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the
simple Word documents i receive from others).

always thought "not being stupid (most of the time)" was a fairly low

This isn't particularly well-founded logic. What you're saying is
that "most rich people are smart" and that the latter is causal to
the former. By implication, then, you would say that "most poor
people are stupid". This is true, statistically, because most
people are poor and most people are also stupid. However there's
nothing to indicate a causal link there. So being smart isn't the
only mechanical requirement to eternal wealth because, obviously,
most of the members of this list would be rich.

Being smart, for example, has made Stephen Hawking famous and
respected, but he's not particularly rich. Jennifer Lopez is by
all accounts a complete moron. In fact, spend a weekend in Beverly
Hills and you will encounter vast numbers of people who are
profoundly stupid driving Rolls Royces and shopping at PRADA.

The working class IS the market and the working class IS where
wealth is created. The working class makes long-distance calls,
buys food processors and computers and clothes, and attaches the
value to goods which allows them to be commodified. The working
class saves money, buys Retirement Savings Plans, and invests in
mutual funds which increases the flow of capital through the
investment funnel.

The economic system of the first world is designed to strike a
delicate balance between incentivizing the ruling class to support
wealth-expanding through technological innovation or the
development of new markets. At the 100,000 foot level, recessions
and depressions are created when more wealth is sucked from the
whirlpool than can be supported by the working class through
investment and consumption.

And the people draining the hot tub are the folks in the ruling
class -- people like Ken Lay, Dick Cheney, Bernie Ebbers, et al --
and they simply got too greedy and caused a bubble in the
hydraulics that increased the pressure for a time, but ultimately
wasn't sustainable.

And the money that was lost did not come from the ruling class. It
came from the RSP's and the Equity funds and the Investments of
individual working class -- people who believed these reports and
invested. The wealth of the ruling class was largely pulled out by
the time such investments were exposed to the workers.

So, is the lower caste necessarily stupid for saving money or
investing in retirement plans? I don't think so. Are they stupid
for buying clothes and automobiles? I don't think so.

At the granular level, the notion that "most rich people are rich
because they're smart" is so anecdotal and naive that it's not
worth arguing about, so I won't. Still, a compelling point worth
some clarification.

-Ian.

Basicaly we have gone back to being serfs, only we demand nicer hovels.
WE demand to have paid for a ruling class lord over us, protect us and
bascialy build the castle walls stronger to protect us from all enemys of

If the constitution were allowed to go up for a vite of confiendnce todayI

the INdividual is called on to be thier own guardian...too many demands on
the fraility of human nature...much better to errect protectors, let them
sort it all out, and tell us what we need to do to be happy.

Smart in todays society is having enough Welath, Charm, Will, Power,

Stupid is living under others rules.

They are legally required to do that. I got a similar check because an
insurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough. It might have been
$.02.

Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the
alternative seems to be to keep the money. Do you really want companies
to have a financial incentive to over-bill you 'just a bit' so they
could keep it? For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer
starts adding up.

So I get a check from Pac Bell today (SBC as they're called now).
Turns out, they went to the trouble of printing out, signing, sealing
and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole $0.33.

They easily spent more than this just getting the materials together.
Why the hell do companies bother to do this crap? I mean, isn't there
a bottom line in terms of cost effectiveness? I don't think I missed
the .33, but I sure as hell would have appreciated lower rates in lieu
of being returned pennies.

I'm truly stuck on this though. I don't know whether to frame the
check, burn it, or cash it in. Maybe I should find a way to return to

This isn't particularly well-founded logic. What you're saying is
that "most rich people are smart" and that the latter is causal to
the former. By implication, then, you would say that "most poor
people are stupid". This is true, statistically, because most
people are poor and most people are also stupid.

I never said that rich people are smart, just less stupid than most
other people. And most people who are poor do engage in more reckless
and stupid behavior in my experience; the people that are a bit smarter
don't stay poor for long, so it is a self-selecting population. Hell, I
grew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US and I remember
quite well why the people that stayed poor were poor -- it certainly
wasn't because of The Man. And my parents were poor because they made
lots of stupid choices -- I had front row seats to the whole process.
Unlike many others, I actually learned from the experience.

And I've known a lot of wealthy people (both in a strict monetary sense
and general sense), and I can't think of a one that was a fool. People
who earned their wealth (i.e. 95+% of the wealthy in the US) didn't
manage to do so, and maintain their wealth, because they were fools. It
isn't that these people are that much smarter, they just don't make lots
of bad decisions and stupid mistakes. Being very smart AND not making
lots of stupid mistakes is pretty much a surefire recipe for being
wealthy.

Being smart, for example, has made Stephen Hawking famous and
respected, but he's not particularly rich. Jennifer Lopez is by
all accounts a complete moron. In fact, spend a weekend in Beverly
Hills and you will encounter vast numbers of people who are
profoundly stupid driving Rolls Royces and shopping at PRADA.

You are using a very narrow definition of "smart". Smart doesn't make
you rich, it gives you the *choice* to be rich. Many people (e.g.
Stephen Hawking) are quite happy merely being comfortable and devote
their energy elsewhere than being "rich". But I don't know too many
really smart people that actually choose to live in poverty.

[...ridiculous caricature of wealthy people elided...]
At the granular level, the notion that "most rich people are rich
because they're smart" is so anecdotal and naive that it's not
worth arguing about, so I won't. Still, a compelling point worth
some clarification.

It sounds like you've bought into the absurd Hollywood depictions of
what wealthy people are like. Hint: they are exactly like you and me,
but with a higher net worth. In the U.S., the fact is that two-thirds
of the millionaires are blue collar folks who worked very smart and very
hard, and the vast majority of all the wealthy in the U.S. are
completely self-made (i.e. first-generation wealthy). "Old wealth" is
incredibly rare in the U.S., as it typically comes and goes within three
generations, and the handful that you do hear about are the unusually
long-lived exceptions.

It's quite simple to become wealthy in the U.S. if you put some effort
into it. However, most people prefer to merely be comfortable and
expend a lot less energy. Virtually all the people I know who are
wealthy are chronic workaholics with above average intelligence and
exaggerated amounts of drive. Most people would not consider those
people's lives "fun", though those people tend to enjoy what they do.

What I -said- in my post, John, was that instead of having to dole out
stupid refunds, I'd rather they save the costs incurred, knock off one
of those bullshit surcharges that they inevitably charge for promoting
services like these, and move on. SOmething tells me, it'd balance
out. Problem is, they're silly, they don't want to do this, and
rather than the legislation coming up with an affective means of
controlling the situation (overcharging) they impose silly
requirements like this.

I suppose Canada, which is supposed to be a "loose confederation" of 2
founding nations (French and English) can be cited as a success. The
jury is still out, but so far only a few brief rebellions and
referendums and such, still together after 130+ years.

Alberta, and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces, is
definitely not happy with the current arrangement. Some of this has to
do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured. When I
was last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting
something like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over
several distinct issues.

The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse
that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their
interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in
Ottawa. While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to
Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token
representation in the federal government. While I'm not clear on
exactly how the government works up there, representation is not
entirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern
provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have
substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire
province of Alberta.

The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta
as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so
much as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the
sparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having
fewer people. Or something like that. The Canadian government is less
restricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like
having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces,
Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities. It is
essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the
inter-mountain West of the US. Unlike the US case though, the rest of
Canada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those tax
dollars from Alberta. OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.

I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totally
clear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial
unfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a little
fuzzy on some of the details. What I do know is that on average the
Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and
the sentiment has been getting worse over the years.

Before there is a jump off to some thread I cant be around to respond to
(contractions now getting closer and longer and stronger but the kids head

(and this is the short rambling take on America as it stands today, so
flesh it our for me if you want)

The problem with america is not its goverment, its companies, its
corportate raider mentality, its throw away buy a new one culture, its not
that we are greedy or shallow or over religious or under religious or even
religious in the context of a secular ruling system......

The problem with america is its citizens, the things that make it up. We
are not greedy, we are sheep. We are easily led from one trend to the
next, we are diverted in our lives to follow any one of a number of media
induced "goals" that run us through commericalistic hoops shedding not
only our worth but our fine grain value as individuals.

We are a nation of a million differnt parts seeking a homogony of sameness
thru right thought, right action right purcheses right hopes right dreams
right teampicking right listeningtothem right mouthingoftheessentialwords
and right sameness

We seek to loose the individuality of our past by plunging headlong into
the lava searing melting pot to come out with all our quak spins set the
same as anyone else.

In so doing we subvert and subject ourselves tothe "status quo" in ways
that makes Islam look like an excersise in free will and hippy love
magic.

We have allowed a subset of our citizens to set the pace for us, mostly
because to set the pace sets you apart and that is a bad thing in the
melting pot society. Thats why the rulers, the trend setters, the rich and
the famous are the THEM.

We then follow that with THEY set us up to do, we run the various rat
mazes that have been constructed and call this a live, We chase the
cheese, which is green, moldy and made of paper. We climb the moutians set
up as goals. We fight the OTHERS who we are told are evil. In the end we
judge our living on how well we followed one of the mazes and how fat we
are before the slaughter.

We are the blue collar worker, the office worker, the disability con, the
tech warrior, the homemaker, the godfearing do gooder, the celeb.

Subject: RE: The Curse of India's Socialism

When I'd read that "getting legal title
can take 20 years", when I believe that
1 year ought to be more than sufficient,
(and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd
assumed that we were talking about the
urban poor.

If I see people living in mansions, or
even in suburban subdivisions, I assume
they didn't have too much trouble with
their titles.

Pg 177:
In another country, a local newspaper, intrigued by our evidence of
extralegal real estate holdings, checked to see if the head of state's
official residence had a recorded title. It did not.

Pg 92:
The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square
meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's
informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go
as high as US$3,000.

==========

I'd have made the same assumption you did. De Soto says that isn't
correct. You can find mansions that don't have title. A lot of them,
in fact. But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise
participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.

Mr. Long, I think you'd particularly enjoy the De Soto work.

On the "to find" list. Any chance of
an explanation of that "Bell Jar" in
the meantime?

French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)

==>

The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,
which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if
in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and
conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate
of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the
whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly
paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was
not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent
country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...
between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence
under Lorenzo the Magnificent?

--------------

De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those
who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do
not. The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property. What they
don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital
and allow it to start growing. Their property can only be exchanged
with a small section of people who know them personally.

[1] Actual poor people, not 'poor' Americans with a living standard that
is the envy of most of the world.

Political mail (the snail kind) doesn't bother me. I like it a lot of the
time, because as crap as it is at least it's not the kind of info you get
on TV. Particularly for small time local politics, it's the best way to
get information.

but what matters is that mail is speech, and political email has to be as
well protected as any other political speech. Spam is *the* tool for
dissident news, since the face that it's unsolicited means that recipients
can't be blamed for being on a mailing list.

Fear not poor Tom, between the pain & endorphins and/or massive
amounts of drugs, she should remember little of the process. Her body
is designed to block out the whole event, so that she can tell other
women "oh having the baby wasnt so bad, you should have one!". Why
else would any woman be willing to EVER have sex.

This tells me two things:
1. You are truly male.
2. You are a male who has a very narrow view of what sex is about.

(:

Having not had a baby meself, but having listened to my mother and
countless others retell the tale, I'd reccomend to Adam a few bits of
advice:
1) We don't generally have sex just to get preggers. You'd never get
laid if that was the case. BUt hey, if we can convince you that the reason
women don't have sex with you adam is because they don't want to carry
your embittered, angry child, well hey. Girls Win!
2) Birth control. Let me say this again because Adam has forgotten the
last 50 years (at least for the pill) BIRTH control.
3) For many women with men who can actually uh... satisfy, sex is great.
Maybe you're lacking in this department ? ;)

So moral of the story: Women, keep telling Adam that no one will have
sex with him because they don't want to get preggers with his angry,
bitter children and go through the pain of childbirth.
yea.. thats it.

Suppose I created a rule that was in this form:

Would the "/d" delete this text from the body and mask it from the rest of the

that FPs are reduced.

To date, the scores evolved by SpamAssassin are very biased towards

That's understandable. HTML mail is the worst thing since female

This should mean that tests which match common-enough newsletter practices

Sound pretty slick. If I come across any more legit newsletters,
I'll send them your way.

I'm fairly confused here, with Procmail.
I know this isn't a procmail list per-se; feel free to answer my questions in
private email to r_gilmanhunt@hotp.com.

I've looked for web-stuff to answer this question but I can't find anything
specific on this scenario.

Here's the situation.
I have a global /etc/procmailrc file. It works, and when I insert stuff into
it for logging (LOGFILE=/root/procmail.log, VERBOSE=yeah. LOGABSTRACT=all) it
shows up where I expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log) At the end of
this file, I use
:0fw
| spamc
to call spamassassin.

Also in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it's one of the evils we do
for our corporate masters) (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed
that they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about
future lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made. Discussion
on this point is immaterial)
:0
* ? test -d $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR || mkdir -p --mode=750 $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR
{ }
:0 c
$SAVEAT

I have several users where I forward certain spams to /dev/null . . .their
procmailrc file (/home/$user/.procmailrc) looks like this:
:0
* ^From: .*spermfun.com
/dev/null

Now I've got a person who needs a copy of her inbound emails sent to another
email address (outside the company), so I've got this recipe in her
/home/$user/.procmailrc file:
:0 c
!user@domain.tld

It almost looks like procmail's not running a user's copy recipe after a
global copy recipe, except that I can replace that user's one with
:0
* ^Subject: .*test
procmail.holder
and get the same result.

The result, to put it succinctly, is "nothing". No forwards go out, no files
are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the
user/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun
example above) and still nothing. However, I can redirect those other
messages. In other words- just this user's procmailrc file is not working-
other users have no problems.

Any suggestions would be helpful :)

Congratulations!!

A few observations:

All children are different and will generally route around whatever
technique you learned from relatives, books, talk shows, or the last child.

Just when you get good at being a parent, you're done.

Don't overprotect. I always called this "First Baby Syndrome". A
neighbor at one point had a 4 or 5 year old that would choke on jello,
probably because she never allowed him to have solid food until he was
far too old, IMHO. I fed mine cereal, etc., early and let them get the
hang of it. I always want my kids to be able to handle anything if I'm
not there so I have them try it out when I am. (Within limits of
course.) Of course, I'm now beating up my body at Vans Skate Park trying
to do 5ft. half pipes on speed skates with my 10 year old daughter.

Owen Byrne:
I think his beef is that the laws for personal bankruptcy are being
rewritten without touching
corporate bankruptcy, another example of how the legal construct known as a
"corporation"
is treated more favorably than the non-legal construct known as a "human
being."

Yeah, I get that. I just think this is a poor
example. Corporate bankruptcy is a power fight
between creditors, management, and shareholders
over control of assets. Because a corporation is
incorporeal (hee, hee), it can't be much else.

If you're concerned about the imbalance of power
related to corporations, I think the more relevant
areas are tax structures, especially the income
tax, various forms of externality, law related to
employment, corporate transparency, and corporate
governance.

Interesting. It's possible, of course, that the shitty economy
is hurting the spammers as much as anyone else. But if you've
been aggressively reporting, then it could just be that. Could
be your upstream ISP is being more aggressive too...

One scam to rule them all,

And the stupidity bind them.

(Yes, i'm ripping, and badly from LOTR)

Alright, so NPR's All Things Considered had a wonderful story on the whole Nigerian 419 scams that seem to be running
into my inbox constantly (Thanks FoRK!) Turns out, these 419 scams (419 is the statute in Nigeria that this particular form
of fraud falls under) have actually snared a few people -- NPR reported to the tune of 100 million dollars over a few years, in the US alone.

One website listed the 419 scam as being the 'third to fith largest industry in Nigeria' (1), netting billions of dollars
from around the world. Its large enough to warrant a governmental investigation and a special number to call and report
(to the secret service, no less) scam abuse. (2) Folks are apparently being held for ransom if they decide to go
'check out' the scam. (3).

Listen to the NPR article (4). What's great about NPR is the commentary at the end. Turns out, this is all unbelievably
common. The origination, at least to NPR's knowledge, starts with the scam elements being transposed from Nigeria,
to London, England. Instead of the bereved widow of a Nigerian national, the originating con was directed to the 'heirs'
of Sir Frances Drake's estate. If you were 'chosen' as an heir, you could contribute a portion of your money so that a
fellow heir (and scam artist) could reclaim the monetary largess in the Court of England, by proving that Elizabeth I had
nulled Sir Drake's will and taken his fortune as her own. Oscar
Hartzell, the gent who started this scam, way back in the early 1800s,
managed to gain quite a fortune, all on the backs of idiots. Sound familiar?

A fool and his money, deserve to be parted.

I've sent in some spam that either didn't score or scored practically

Coincidentally enough, I'm currently in the middle of a pretty good book

Has this extension been discussed before (and perhaps rejected)?
Or perhaps someone is already planning to implement it?
Or would you be interested to integrate a smtp-callback-patch in
SpamAssassin if contributed by my department? We would not be to happy
about such a patch which we had to manage and integrate with SA in the
future, but I believe a one-time contribution would be no problem.

How'd this deal with you running SA on an account where all the mail from some

Yes, and the working class deserves what it gets, ...

Careful now, you're talking about
most (80%) of the country.

(although perhaps it is true that in
a democracy, the people wind up with
the government which they deserve)

... I grew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US ...

... and there is a large excluded middle
between those "in poverty" and those who
are more affluent than "working class".

I don't know what poverty officially is,
but from a CA perspective, $15k income is
not going to go far. At current interest
rates, one would probably want somewhere
around $500k* wealth to throw that amount,
which pretty much limits the non-working
class to a small, single-digit percentage
of households. (how much overlap do we
have with the retirement cohort here?)

The 2000 numbers pretty much confirm it:

shows that the top 5% of incomes are mostly
two+-earner households, and the zero-earner
households are rare above median incomes.
We are the workers' paradise.

The census figured $18k as the cutoff for
lowest 5th, so with that as a poverty line,
the percentages break down as follows:

work\pov. yes no
yes 9 72
no 11 8

"[Irvine] "Everyone has to take a job sometime" / NH3"

in 2001, but I haven't seen it yet on the

Do you punish the whole industry due to a few bad apples?

From what little I have heard, the
legislation simply says that lying
in one's public figures is not just
a matter of cheating the accounts,
but really involves stealing time
and money from one's employees and
investors. How does not tolerating
the bad apples equate to punishing
the good ones?

WASHINGTON--Hewlett Packard has found a new club to use to pound
researchers who unearth flaws in the company's software: the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act.

Invoking both the controversial 1998 DMCA and computer crime laws, HP
has threatened to sue a team of researchers who publicized a
vulnerability in the company's Tru64 Unix operating system.

In a letter sent on Monday, an HP vice president warned SnoSoft, a
loosely organized research collective, that it "could be fined up to
$500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years" for its role in
publishing information on a bug that lets an intruder take over a
Tru64 Unix system.

HP's dramatic warning appears to be the first time the DMCA has been
invoked to stifle research related to computer security. Until now,
it's been used by copyright holders to pursue people who distribute
computer programs that unlock copyrighted content such as DVDs or
encrypted e-books.

If HP files suit or persuades the federal government to prosecute, the
company could set a precedent that stifles research into computer
security flaws, a practice that frequently involves publishing code
that demonstrates vulnerabilities. The DMCA restricts code that "is
primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing
protection" of copyrighted works.

On July 19, a researcher at SnoSoft posted a note to
SecurityFocus.com's popular Bugtraq mailing list with a hyperlink to a
computer program letting a Tru64 user gain full administrator
privileges. The researcher, who goes by the alias "Phased," said in
the message: "Here is the warez, nothing special, but it does the
job."

That public disclosure drew the ire of Kent Ferson, a vice president
in HP's Unix systems unit, who alleged in his letter on Monday that
the post violated the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

Boy, that is rather strange. I've always been under the impression that
the uncontrollable forest fires were the result of the Forest Service's
long-standing "10:00 A.M. policy", in place until the decision in 1963 to
switch over to "let-it-burn".

The 10:00 A.M. policy was based on theories about forest management from
Europe, and wasn't as applicable to the American wilds. So, we went from a
policy of containment for 100 years to one of letting things burn unless they
directly threatened property.

40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of stuff
left to burn. I can't imagine that artificially planted replacement
forests, with dense stands of identical trees, help that much either.

I would be comfortable laying the fault for these contributing factors
squarely with the Forest Service. I would put the blame for many burned homes
upon the people who chose to build their dwelling with an unwise combination of
materials, location, and landscaping.

Or.... you could just not bloat it 20x to begin with. Nah! (that was the

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount

If you'll look closely, I said the Forest Service official claimed it was
the tree lovers lawsuits that prevented removal of trees by any means as at
least partially responsible. The lawsuits prevented the Forest Service
from implementation of any project that involved tree removal. These
projects were designed to address the tree and undergrowth density that
resulted from previous management policies.

In other words, Forest Service projects to clean up the mess resulting from
their previous forest management practices are prevented by tree lover
lawsuits.

40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of
stuff

Exactly, and tree lover lawsuits are preventing the removal of that
stuff. The result: Fires like Cerro Grande.

There are very few replacement forests planted these days. Those that are,
are mostly planted on private land as commercial tree farms.

*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*
By Declan McCullagh
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT
http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html

*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that
would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy
surveillance by police and spy agencies.*

A discussion draft
released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every
Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the
right to be anonymous online.

The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice
and Industry Canada
, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step
in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to
conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion
draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in
early 2003.

Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form,
Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and
combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting
these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the
Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty
, which the country is in the
process of considering.

If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the
possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet
providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and
permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find "hidden
electronic and digital devices" that a suspect might be concealing. In
most circumstances, a court order would be required for government
agents to conduct Internet monitoring.

Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of
Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have
endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty
, which has
drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups.
Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted
,
or ratified, the treaty.

Michael Geist , a professor at the
University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the
justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems
weak.

"It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the
changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to
make changes," Geist said. "To me that's not a particularly convincing
argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority,
make that case."

Geist added that "there's nothing in the document that indicates (new
powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant
number of cases where police have run into problems."

Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is
compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure
their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention
orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act
, but it
applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.

"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and
Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical
capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national
security agencies," according to the proposal. Companies would be
responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.

Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center
(EPIC) who specializes in international law, says
the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. "Their
proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not
just Internet providers," Andrews said. "The cybercrime treaty deals
only with computer data." EPIC opposes

the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and
does not adequately respect privacy rights.

Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs
of Police recommends "the establishment of a national database" with
personal information about all Canadian Internet users. "The
implementation of such a database would presuppose that service
providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"
the draft says.

Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an
activist with Privacy International, calls the database "a dumb idea."

"Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous
mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet
anonymously," Hosein said.

A representative for George Radwanski
, Canada's privacy commissioner, said
the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not "have any comments on
the paper as it stands."

Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca
no later than Nov. 15.

Okay, I'll ammend that to LIVE OLD tree saving, like the thousands of
acres of virgin pine forest that was razed here in MS so that our military
can practice desert warfare? Fought it for years, lost, now there is a
stand of trees up and down Hwy 49 that's supposed to try to hide the fact
that a huge portion of the Desoto Ntl. Forest is gone.

etc (lots and lots of etc)

I can agree with most of this list except tree saving.

Please understand, I'm in favor of forests. I'm not in favor of messing
with natural processes that forests and trees have evolved over millions of
years.

Every time I look toward the west from my house I see the result of overly
aggressive tree saving. The Cerro Grande fire that destroyed many (200+)
houses and an area bigger than Boston.

The Santa Fe watershed, which has as many as 1200 trees per acre in an area
that if left to nature would have 30-60 trees per acre. When the Forest
Service attempted to cull trees in their part of the watershed, the tree
lovers stopped the program with law suits.

A number of other projects have been stopped by similar suits. For
example, a fire south of Los Alamos that left many usable, but partially
burned, trees standing. The Forest Service started a project to allow
loggers to take those trees. Hah! The tree lovers stopped that. Can't
have the loggers go into the forest even if the trees being taken are
already burned and the roads necessary to get to the trees are already built.

A Forest Service official has stated flat out that the tree lovers need to
understand their responsibility in contributing to the number of
uncontrollable (i.e., crown fires caused by very dense tree stands and
under growth) fires by their suits to stop any tree removal from the
forests managed by the Forest Service.

I am writing having survived another season of forest fires. One that saw
many more fires than normal because of the severe drought occurring here in
the Southwest (even though there are still quite a few fires burning).

I'm not sure what you mean by "let's you and him fight", but it is
important to remember that England was in control of Ireland
for 300 years ...

Exactly -- "let's you and him fight" is a
way of dealing with troublesome populations
by moving them next to one another, so they
give each other, and not the Man, grief*.

So by my understanding (and, you all will
understand, with tongue firmly in cheek):

Ireland: Irish? Uppity barbarians overly
fond of "risings". Scots? More uppity
barbarians overly fond of "risings".
Why not plonk down a bunch of the latter
next to the former and kill two birds
with one stone?

Israel: Ex-ottomans? Uppity barbarians
(didn't they help kick out the Ottomans?)
Zionists? Uppity sorts who aren't happy
with perfectly good land in Uganda. Why
not plonk down a bunch of the latter next
to the former and kill two birds with one
stone?

but not:

India: in which the muslims and hindus were
originally intermixed to some degree,
but Partioned due to their own conflict,
not due to English resettlement policy.

Canada: in which the french and english were
already established, and it was just the
balance of power on the continent that
determined events in the colonies. The
Acadians got resettled, but they don't
seem to have been that good for picking
fights with their neighbors, so no one

paranoiac tendencies.

Then again, maybe you're right, it's a very close match in job
descriptions. Obviously it does not concern anyone else, and since
it's none of my business, I'll shut up about it and put it down to
more funky fun in US politics.

Afterall, all I know for certain about the Mormons is the background
and fallout on my ex-wife's excommunication ;)

I'm perfectly willing to can-opener that code and see where the CPU is
going, but only if nobody is slapping their forehead and mumbling about
a brown-paper-bag bug... ;)

As I mentioned in my email to Anders, it's certainly in my code and I don't
have time to work on it right now, so I would not be offended if you worked on
it.

I just this moment found out that my partner has promised a few things would be
done before my vacation that will require my efforts, so it's even more true
that it was when I sent the mail to Anders.

The HyShot experiment - attempting the world`s first flight test of the
supersonic combustion process - was launched at 1135 local time (1205 AEST)
at the Woomera Prohibited Area, 500km north of Adelaide today.

Eh? AFAIK, the Russian Kholod program achieved successful supersonic

lately I've got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower. I
just decided to check that vs. reality, and yes, speed has left the
scene somewhere between the release of 2.5 and now.

I checked on a number of small messages in a big folder (~10000
msgs). The delay of the Next button has increased considerably:

2.5-release: 350-450 msec
latest cvs: 1000-12000 msec

Frankly I think this is getting close to non-acceptable since the
user settings hasn't changed.

Anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared?
Most likely in the added overhead of managing more sequences.
I'm sure it can be tuned a bunch, but as I'm leaving for a vacation on
Friday, and have plenty of "real work" to do, I won't be able to do
much until I get back.

I *will* look at all this when I get back, but if you want to check
into what's slow and fix things while I'm gone, my feelings won't be
hurt.

Just one more info. I measured the time spent wrapping the stuff in
Ftoc_Next with time {} so the data is for real. One difference
between mine and Valdis' setup (judging from his trace) is that I use
the address book. I've been doing that for ages so that can't be the
problem.

Is there a way to get the log to print time with higher granularity?

How hot it feels is affected by both temperature and humidity. In

As I know from experience, Mississippi feels a lot hotter at 90 degrees F.
than home (Santa Fe) does at 90.

Perhaps the military didn't want to train in a real desert because 1) it
get's over 100 degrees and any time the air temp is greater than body temp
it affects performance, and 2) when those troops go to a real desert
they'll think it's so much nicer than Mississippi.

No, I'm not maligning Mississippi. I had a great time passing through last

I'm not seeing a hit on 'next'. A quick "just pound on 'next' and
watch the wall clock" test shows me able to go through 20 messages in
under 5 seconds, so it's well under 250ms per switch, but I'm seeing a
really piggy CPU spike (100% for a few seconds) in the 'flist' code.
Of course, it seems to be related to number-of-folders:

[~] wc Mail/.folders
131 131 1122 Mail/.folders

I have 167 folders (!) and run with bg-proc set to flist (1 minute).
I see delays, but not that much. Maybe 1-3 seconds (which tend to
disappear these days). This is on a PII-266.

Then again, if 57% of CEOs have the time to be as up on technology as
their CIO, either one or maybe even /both/ of them are maybe not doing
their job, and maybe that's yet another reason the dot-bubble burst.

Assuming it's my fault (which it probably is since nobody else has really been

I'd guess that something is either being called that shouldn't be or is being
called more times than it should be.

Is there a way to get the log to print time with higher granularity?

Not that I'm aware of. If you look in the code, there are various places
where the time function is called in order to see how long it took to do
things. You'll probably want to borrow that technique.

Just a big *thank you* to Chris for being willing to dive in and get

When this stabilizes, it will be a great excuse for a 2.6 release.

"There are two kinds of people in this world, right? Nonbelievers and

plaNET.wall.street Internet conference last week. "In other words, those

InfoSpace CEO to step down

BELLEVUE, Wash. AP) - InfoSpace Inc. chairman and chief executive Naveen
Jain will step down from his posts once the Internet services and software
company finds a replacement.

Jain, a former Microsoft executive, founded InfoSpace six years ago and led
the company through its rise and fall. His departure from the top posts was
announced Wednesday.

With its stock now trading for dimes, InfoSpace is in danger of being
delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market. The company is asking shareholders
to approve a one-for-10 reverse stock split to prop up the price. If
approved on Sept. 12, shareholders would trade in 10 shares of stock for
one new share.

The company has had trouble retaining its top-level executives in the past,
including most recently, former chief executive Arun Sarin who resigned
last year after just nine months on the job.

The company said Jain will remain as a company employee.

Shares of InfoSpace fell 2 cents to 43 cents in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

Don't worry too much about it, you seem to have plenty of other things
to do in the immediate future, and this one isn't so critical that people
can't use the code in normal ways.

But, to make it happen, type (with normal key bindings) any digit, so the
code thinks you're trying a message number, then backspace, so the digit
goes away, then '-' (other junk characters don't seem to have the
problem, I have just been playing). That will do it (every time).

That is: 0 ^h -

Once you get into that state, the same traceback occurs for every

This is looking like it might be easy to find and fix, so I'll take a

http://www.therockalltimes.co.uk/2002/04/08/new-tags.html

W3C approves HTML 4 'emotitags' - Now you'll be able to say it with
feeling
by Lester Haines

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has approved a number of new html
'emotitags' which will revolutionise the web surfing experience.

The tags have no physical effect, but rather elicit a strong emotional
response from the reader. Top of the list is (War on TerrorT). The
tag, when judiciously applied, will immediately provoke violent anger
against ragheads, thus:

Charity agencies report that Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has
adopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political
opponents.

Of particular interest to British code-monkeys is the new (I'm
hurting too). This is designed for use when reporting on the life of
Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous people:

She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her
instinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly
missed.

The instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and
self-indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset
about the death of a complete stranger.

Political reporting also looks to benefit from the new tag. Any
government ministerial pronouncement is thus rendered immediately
transparent:

Tony Blair was quick to defend transport secretary Byers, calling
him "the most honest man it has been my privilege to know".

And, in a much-needed boost to satire sites, W3C has formally ratified
the controversial . This guarantees any text contained within
it complete immunity from prosecution:

Naomi Campbell, we can confirm, is a talentless, drug-addicted
perjurer who believes that good looks alone can justify her appalling
and obnoxious behaviour.

The new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C
has, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has
further cautioned that they should never be used together, since the
effect on the reader could be catastrophic:

In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen
victim to Sadaam Hussein's Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme,
Stephen Byers noted: "She was everybody's favourite grandmother who
touched the lives of billions. The only consolation we can gain from
this tragedy is that all of the UK's trains will be running on time by
next Monday. And you can quote me on that."

http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

I may be wrong but I think a single select entry field is used
for selecting messages and switching folders. Restricting the entries
to be numeric would break the folder switching functionality, wouldn't
it?

My version of MsgChange, not yet updated, has a check

if {$msgid != {}} {
# Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line instead
if {$msgid , Brent Welch writes:

Yes, I looked at "fixing" it there, but that code is really quite
general, with almost no understanding of what anything means, so I
didn't think that corrupting it with knowlwedge of the semantics of
what it is fetching would really be the best thing to do.

I ran out of time last night while looking for a better place for
a similar check (I would have gone directly to the regexp - I'm not
that up to date with all the latest tcl changes...) and I'm not sure
I will have time today, but I will keep looking.

the source of much funniness.

I have some patches that seem to fix/avoid this problem now. (It is
amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for
UPS's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and
its battery supply...)

First, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was
occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a
sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of
such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback.
This one solves the initial problem:

--- mh.tcl.WASThu Aug 22 21:15:06 2002

+ # just ignore anything bogus
+ continue;
+}
set parts [split [string trim $range] -]
if {[llength $parts] == 1} {
lappend seq $parts

That is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring
before (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should
probably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just "continue"
if you like, but I don't think an error is needed).

But that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place,
by typing "NNN-" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this,
I thought I should think more about Brent's suggestion. But rather than
have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it
would have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to
do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck
a "catch" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the
user has typed.

This way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe
allowing a sequence name, like "prev" or "next", or anything else can
be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have
to go fix the selection processing code to allow it.

But, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.
If you type "66+" the "66" changes to "67" (and so on, for each + that
is typed). I suspect that's perhaps an artifact of "+ is bound to a
different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the
current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current
input mode is a message number, so let it mean...", but now I found it,
I think its nice. But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well? That
kind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.

And then I wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special
use of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from
the keyboard. So I fixed that as well. This makes two different
restrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name
beginning with '+' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,
so I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to
toggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name
being typed is empty. I'm less happy about that part, but I think I
can live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to
exist and be typed.

Then, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another
feature that has always bugged me. In "normal" keyboard mode, 's' is
the key used to show a message. But if you've just typed 123, and
the FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now
show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \r instead.
So I "fixed" this one as well. "Fixed" here is in quotes, as it assumes
that the keybinding for MsgShow is 's', if you change that to something
else, it will remain 's' in here. I don't know enough tk/tcl to have it
discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order
to bind the same one here. \r continues to work of course.

And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it
clear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).
Previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next
message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had
reverted to its usual bindings.

In any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that. I believe
that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the
"catch" around the "MsgShow" will hide the problem (I don't think we really
need to fix Brent's way of invoking it). Or include it anyway, just
for completeness (I haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not
the previous one, so I don't know for sure that all will be OK then).

Sender: owner-cypherpunks@lne.com

Just read this paper published in PET02 "Towards an Information
Theoretic Metric for Anonymity" [1]:

http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~gd216/set.pdf
orhttp://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~gd216/set.ps

it uses a Shannon like entropy model for the anonymity provided by a
system uses this model to analyse the effect of different parameters
one can tune with mixmaster (POOLSIZE, RATE, in mixmaster.conf).

The "anonymity entropy" measurement can be interpreted as how many
bits of information the attacker needs to identify a user and is
computed from probabilities.

Would be interesting to try estimate the entropy provided by the
current mixmaster network. A number of nodes publish their parameter
choices, and traffic volume over time (in hourly increments).

Why we're changing our publishing schedule

Dear Reader,

As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday

Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines. I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.

Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.

Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.

For now, the new schedule is being called a "test," which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works.

I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.

Sincerely,

David Coursey

| hmmm, I assume you're going to report this to the nmh folks?

It turns out, when I did some investigation, that my memory of how MH
worked here was wrong (that's not unusual) - the -seq switch seems to
have always done -nolist (requiring a subsequent -list to turn it on
again).

Given that, I have no idea how the pick code as it was ever worked. In
fact, it quite possibly never did the way it was intended to (I have just
been browsing the 2.5 sources, and that seems to be attempting to do things
that I never saw happen).

It may be that your new sequence method just exposed the bug that had been
there all along.

Given this, I won't be sending any bug reports to the nmh people. If nmh
ever seems to be showing any signs further progress, and if I remember this
then, I might send them a change request. The code to make the change is
trivial.

Don't know if everybody knows this trick...

Puts 127.0.0.1 as the IP for adservers. Elegant.

==

http://technoerotica.net/mylog/hostfile.html

As mentioned throughout this site, there is more than one way to skin a cat
when it comes to pop-ups. The hosts file is one of the most effective
methods there is. In brief, a hosts file is a text file used by Windows to
resolve domain names and IP addresses. If you're running windows, you
already have a hosts file but it most likely isn't being used.

What a hosts file does is simple, it lists domains and IP numbers. To get
rid of ads, the hosts file lists the domain names of adservers along with
the IP number 127.0.0.1. This tells windows to grab any content from the
listed domain from the specified IP number. The specified IP number in this
case is your own computer. What happens is that it won't display the ad. If
you choose this method of ad removal there is no need to use our opt out
links. The hosts file is a very effective mechanism.

You can download this hosts file, unzip it and place it in your Windows
directory. YOU SHOULD MAKE A BACK UP of your existing hosts file before you
do. The hosts file is called "hosts" there is no extension. You may have a
file named Hosts.sam this is merely a sample hosts file.

Once you download the file and put it in the windows folder, reboot your
computer and it's a done deal. Pretty simple huh? You might want to look at
the contents of this file as it contains additional information as well as
an address for getting updated versions.

Because we're inherently lazy, this works for windows only, don't use it on
a mac! Follow the address in the hosts file for alternative system
instructions.
download now

We didn't write this file and do not provide support for it's use. Follow
the address in the hosts file for questions. It's not that we don't want to
hear from you but the folks at this address have the answers you need.

I've now stabilized everything pretty well for my paid job, so I'll probably

Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has
been in there since before 1998. (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to
sequences.tcl and back again). I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a
one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages
removed. (I think.)

It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current

Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the

That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and
Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it
only reads the sequences if the file has been touched. Look for the
"Exmh_Debug Reading $filename" output in the debug log to see when sequences
are actually reread from disk.

My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often. I'm about to
investigate that.

lately I've got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower. I
just decided to check that vs. reality, and yes, speed has left the
scene somewhere between the release of 2.5 and now.

I checked on a number of small messages in a big folder (~10000
msgs). The delay of the Next button has increased considerably:

2.5-release: 350-450 msec
latest cvs: 1000-12000 msec

Frankly I think this is getting close to non-acceptable since the
user settings hasn't changed.

Anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared?

Here's a fix that I think will make a real difference.

Ftoc_ShowSequences needs to be able to be called with an optional list of msgids
to update and if it's called that way it only removes or adds tags for those
messages. Then in places like MsgChange, we only update the messages which have
changed.

Also, a separate Ftoc_ShowSequence function which only updates the display of
one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids.
In a place like MsgChange, it would only need to update the cur sequence.

If nobody else gets to it, I'll do this when I get back.

That was my thinking. My recollection about the first message being valid
is that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting,
for example, or you are selecting a message to display.

It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current
folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the
directory). Does tcl have a directory read function? I assume so...

glob -nocomplain $mhProfile(path)/$folder *
will return an unsorted list of the directory's contents.
But the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun.
Exmh already maintains in-core lists of messages in sequences, which is
already pretty tricky

Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the
context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.

In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify time,
but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to
check their date stamp, you could just read them again. Also, now that
we checkpoint message state on every message view, that file will change
every time. In the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about
the folder.

Do you really think this is true? I added a modify time check thinking that
it would make an improvement since we were reading it a *lot* more times in
the new code because we're trying to use the sequences.

On the other hand, the sequences files are probably being read out of cache
when that happens anyway.

Even with a small file, I'd think that the time taken to do a
[file mtime $filename] would be worth it. My code is in proc MhReadSeqs.

This article from NYTimes.com
has been sent to you by luke@applix.com.

The mind boggles at the idea that the Bush administration has not bothered to find a serious rationale at all, much less one extraordinary enough to justify these extraordinary measures, much less present it to the public, and that the Bush administration appears to be against American-style justice.

The default explanation for government secrecy is to conceal official wrongdoing. The administration is here making the case that Americans don't even have a right to question government secrecy.

We may find that the history of this past year has been an epic looting from the public, made possible by the urgency of reacting to 9/11.

After Sept. 11, a Legal Battle Over Limits of Civil Liberty

August 4, 2002
By THE NEW YORK TIMES

This article was reported and written by Adam Liptak, Neil
A. Lewis and Benjamin Weiser.

In the fearful aftermath of Sept. 11, Attorney General John
Ashcroft vowed to use the full might of the federal
government and "every available statute" to hunt down and
punish "the terrorists among us."

The roundup that followed the attacks, conducted with
wartime urgency and uncommon secrecy, led to the detentions
of more than 1,200 people suspected of violating
immigration laws, being material witnesses to terrorism or
fighting for the enemy.

The government's effort has produced few if any law
enforcement coups. Most of the detainees have since been
released or deported, with fewer than 200 still being held.

But it has provoked a sprawling legal battle, now being
waged in federal courthouses around the country, that
experts say has begun to redefine the delicate balance
between individual liberties and national security.

The main combatants are the attorney general and federal
prosecutors on one side and a network of public defenders,
immigration and criminal defense lawyers, civil
libertarians and some constitutional scholars on the other,
with federal judges in between.

The government's record has so far been decidedly mixed. As
it has pushed civil liberties protections to their limits,
the courts, particularly at the trial level, have pushed
back, stopping well short of endorsing Mr. Ashcroft's
tactics or the rationales he has offered to justify them.
Federal judges have, however, allowed the government to
hold two American citizens without charges in military
brigs, indefinitely, incommunicado and without a road map
for how they might even challenge their detentions.

In the nation's history, the greatest battles over the
reach of government power have occurred against the
backdrop of wartime. Some scholars say the current
restrictions on civil liberties are relatively minor by
historical standards and in light of the risks the nation
faces.

The current struggle centers on three sets of issues.
People held simply for immigration violations have objected
to new rules requiring that their cases be heard in secret,
and they have leveraged those challenges into an attack on
what they call unconstitutional preventive detentions.

People brought in and jailed as material witnesses, those
thought to have information about terrorist plots, have
argued that they should not be held to give testimony in
grand jury investigations.

Finally, Yasser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla, the two
Americans labeled "enemy combatants" for what the
government contends is more direct involvement with
terrorist groups, are seeking rights once thought to be
fundamental to American citizens, like a lawyer's
representation and a chance to challenge their detentions
before a civilian judge.

So far, federal judges in Newark and Detroit have ordered
secret deportation proceedings opened to public scrutiny,
and on Friday a federal district judge in Washington
ordered that the identities of most of the detainees be
made public under the Freedom of Information Act.

"Secret arrests," Judge Gladys Kessler wrote in the
decision on Friday, "are a concept odious to a democratic
society."

A senior Justice Department official said the detentions
had been lawful and effective. He said it was hard to
"prove a negative" and cite specific terrorist acts that
had been disrupted. But he said that department officials
believed that the detentions had "incapacitated and
disrupted some ongoing terrorist plans."

Two federal judges in New York have differed sharply on
whether the government may jail material witnesses while
they wait to testify in grand jury investigations. In
Virginia, a federal judge ordered the government to allow
Mr. Hamdi to consult a lawyer.

"I look at the federal district court judges and just cheer
them on, because they are doing exactly what an independent
judiciary should be doing," said Jane E. Kirtley, a
professor at the University of Minnesota and former
executive director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom
of the Press. "It's not hostile or adversarial; it's simply
skeptical."

These lower-court decisions have for the most part not yet
been tested on appeal, and there is reason to think that
appeals courts and the Supreme Court will prove more
sympathetic to the government's tactics and arguments.

The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., for instance,
reversed the decision to allow Mr. Hamdi to talk to a
lawyer and ordered the lower court judge to consider
additional evidence and arguments.

But even the appeals court seemed torn, and it rejected the
government's sweeping argument that the courts have no role
in reviewing the government's designation of an American
citizen as an enemy combatant.

The detention issues also carry an emotional punch. Many of
the Arabs and Muslims caught in the government dragnet were
cabdrivers, construction workers or other types of
laborers, and some spent up to seven months in jail before
being cleared of terrorism ties and deported or released.

Last month, at a conference held by a federal appeals
court, Warren Christopher, the secretary of state in the
Clinton administration, snapped at Viet Dinh, an assistant
attorney general under President Bush, saying that the
administration's refusal to identify the people it had
detained reminded him of the "disappeareds" in Argentina.

"I'll never forget going to Argentina and seeing the
mothers marching in the streets asking for the names of
those being held by the government," Mr. Christopher said.
"We must be very careful in this country about taking
people into custody without revealing their names."

Mr. Dinh, who came to the United States as a refugee from
Vietnam, recalled his family's anguish when his father was
taken away in 1975 for "re-education." In contrast, he
said, those detained by the United States were not being
secretly held but were allowed to go to the press and seek
lawyers.

"These are not incognito detentions," he said. "The only
thing we will not do is provide a road map for the
investigations."

According to the Justice Department, 752 of the more than
1,200 people detained since Sept. 11 were held on
immigration charges. Officials said recently that 81
remained in detention. Court papers indicate there were
about two dozen material witnesses, while most of the other
detainees were held on various state and federal criminal
charges.

President Bush also has announced plans to try suspected
foreign terrorists before military tribunals, though no
such charges have been brought yet.

Last month, William G. Young, the federal judge presiding
in Boston over the criminal case against Richard C. Reid, a
British citizen accused of trying to detonate a bomb in his
shoe on a trans-Atlantic flight, noted that the very
establishment of those tribunals "has the effect of
diminishing the American jury, once the central feature of
American justice."

Judge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan,
added: "This is the most profound shift in our legal
institutions in my lifetime and - most remarkable of all -
it has taken place without engaging any broad public
interest whatsoever."

Jack Goldsmith and Cass R. Sunstein, professors at the
University of Chicago Law School, have written that the
Bush administration's policies are a minimal challenge to
civil liberties especially compared with changes during the
times of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. What
has changed, they say, is a greater sensitivity to civil
liberties and a vast increase in mistrust of government.

The Secrecy

U.S. Says Hearings
Are Not Trials

Ten days
after last September's attacks, Michael J. Creppy, the
nation's chief immigration judge, quietly issued sweeping
instructions to hundreds of judges for what would turn out
to be more than 600 "special interest" immigration cases.

"Each of these cases is to be heard separately from all
other cases on the docket," Judge Creppy wrote. "The
courtroom must be closed for these cases - no visitors, no
family, and no press."

"This restriction," he continued, "includes confirming or
denying whether such a case is on the docket."

The government has never formally explained how it decided
which visa violators would be singled out for this
extraordinary process, and it has insisted that the
designations could not be reviewed by the courts.

But as it turns out, most of these cases involved Arab and
Muslim men who were detained in fairly haphazard ways, for
example at traffic stops or through tips from suspicious
neighbors. Law enforcement officials have acknowledged that
only a few of these detainees had any significant
information about possible terrorists.

As the ruling on Friday in Washington suggests, a series of
legal challenges to this secrecy has resulted in striking
legal setbacks for the administration. Several courts have
ordered the proceedings opened and have voiced considerable
skepticism about the government's justifications for its
detention policies generally.

Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the secrecy of the proceedings exacerbated the
hardships faced by people who disappeared from sight on
violations that in the past would not have resulted in
incarceration.

"Preventive detention," he said, "is such a radical
departure from constitutional traditions that we certainly
shouldn't be undertaking it solely on the Justice
Department's say-so."

Malek Zeidan's detention would have been unexceptional had
it not given rise to one of the legal challenges that
threatens to end the secret proceedings.

Mr. Zeidan, 42, is a Syrian citizen who overstayed his visa
14 years ago and has lived in Paterson, N.J., for more than
a decade. Over the years, he has delivered pizzas, driven
an ice cream truck and pumped gas. When the Immigration and
Naturalization Service came around last Jan. 31 to ask him
about a former roommate suspected of marriage fraud, Mr.
Zeidan was working at Dunkin' Donuts, and his expired visa
soon cost him 40 days in custody.

When a hearing was finally held three weeks after his
detention, the judge closed the courtroom, excluding Mr.
Zeidan's cousin and reporters.

The closing of proceedings prompted lawsuits in federal
court, from both Mr. Zeidan and two New Jersey newspapers.
In March, the government dropped the "special interest"
designation, Mr. Zeiden was released after posting a bond,
and the case he filed was dismissed. The immigration
charges against him will be considered in the fall.

"You're one of the lucky ones," his lawyer, Regis
Fernandez, recalls telling Mr. Zeidan, given that other
visa violators were held as long as six or seven months
before being deported or released.

Mr. Zeidan's lawyers believe that their legal strategy,
which focused on openness, forced the government's hand.

"The government was somehow linking secrecy to guilt," Mr.
Fernandez said. "We figured if the public had access to
these hearings they would see that nothing went on except
multiple adjournments and delay."

Through a spokeswoman, Judge Creppy declined to comment. An
I.N.S. official, who spoke on the condition that he not be
named, said the agency had acted properly in Mr. Zeidan's
case and in similar cases.

He said the immigration service had always detained people
without bond who were linked to criminal investigations. He
added that the agency had no choice now but to detain a
visa violator until the Federal Bureau of Investigation was
sure the person was not involved in terrorism.

"Consider the flip side - that you held him for two days
and then deported him, and 30 days later you found out he
was a terrorist," the official said.

The newspapers' lawsuit has continued. It has already once
reached the Supreme Court, and the government's papers
contain one of the fullest accounts of its position on
secrecy and executive power.

Its main argument is that the courts have no role because
immigration hearings are not really trials, but are merely
administrative hearings that can be closed at will.

Bennet Zurofsky, who also represented Mr. Zeidan, said he
was flabbergasted by this suggestion.

"A trial is a trial," he said. "A person's liberty is at
stake. A person is being held in jail. A person is being
told where to live."

But in a sworn statement submitted in several court cases,
Dale L. Watson, the executive assistant director for
counterterrorism and counterintelligence at the F.B.I.,
outlined the reasoning behind the government demand for
total secrecy.

"Bits and pieces of information that may appear innocuous
in isolation can be fit into a bigger picture by terrorist
groups," he said.

This rationale for withholding information, sometimes
called the mosaic theory, is controversial.

"It's impossible to refute," Professor Kirtley said,
"because who can say with certainty that it's not true?"

In May, John W. Bissell, the chief judge of the federal
district court in Newark, appointed by President Reagan,
ruled for the newspapers and ordered all deportation
hearings nationwide to be opened, unless the government is
able to show a need for a closed hearing on a case-by-case
basis. His ruling followed a similar one in Detroit the
month before, though that case involved only a single
detainee.

The government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, and asked it to block Judge
Bissell's order until the appeal was decided. The court,
which will hear arguments in September, declined to do
that. A number of news organizations, including The New
York Times, filed a brief as a friend of the court in
support of the newspapers.

The government then asked the United States Supreme Court
to stay Judge Bissell's order. The court, in a relatively
unusual move given that the case was not before it for any
other purpose, blocked Judge Bissell's order, suggesting
that it might have more sympathy for the government's
arguments.

The Witnesses

Rights Violated,
Lawyers Contend

Late on Sept. 12, federal agents pulled
two nervous Indian men, Mohammed Jaweed Azmath and Syed Gul
Mohammed Shah, off an Amtrak train near Fort Worth. They
were carrying box cutters, black hair dye and about $5,000
in cash and had also shaved their body hair.

The agents' suspicions were obvious. The hijackers had used
box cutters and knives to take control of the aircraft and
had received letters instructing them to "shave excess hair
from the body." An F.B.I. affidavit dated Sept. 15 said
there was probable cause to believe that both of the Indian
men were involved in, or "were associated" with, those
responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks.

But even though government officials told reporters that
the men had been detained as material witnesses, their
lawyers now say that they were held last fall only on
immigration violations.

The distinction is important because a material witness
warrant brings the automatic appointment of a
government-paid lawyer, while the government does not have
to supply a visa violator with counsel.

As a result, the authorities were able to question each of
the men repeatedly about terrorism without a lawyer
present, their current lawyers say.

Like some of the people who were picked up as material
witnesses, the Indian men were held in isolation in jails
in New York for extended periods. It was 91 days before Mr.
Azmath received a lawyer and 57 days before Mr. Shah did,
their lawyers say.

"It's wrong to keep a man in jail for 57 days and never
bring him before a magistrate to advise him of his rights,"
Mr. Shah's lawyer, Lawrence K. Feitell, said in an
interview. "It's wrong not to provide him with an attorney
at the threshold. It's wrong to depict this as an I.N.S.
investigation, when in truth and in fact, it's the main
inquiry into the World Trade Center debacle."

Anthony L. Ricco, the lawyer for Mr. Azmath, said his
client was interrogated "often times for several hours a
day, with multiple interviewers, getting rapid-fire
questions from three or four different people."

Eventually, the F.B.I. and the prosecutors cleared the men
of any involvement in terrorism, and both pleaded guilty in
June in a credit-card fraud scheme and are awaiting
sentencing.

Federal prosecutors said in court papers that both men
consented to questioning. Each "was read and waived his
Miranda rights before each interview," prosecutors wrote,
adding that each man confessed to the credit card offenses.

The United States attorney in Manhattan, James B. Comey,
would not comment on the specific cases, but said generally
of the government's tactics: "I don't see any violation of
any rule, regulation, or law.

"I can understand defense lawyers not being happy," he
said. "But I know our position after 9/11 was to use every
available tool, to stay within the rules but play the whole
field and recognize the boundaries, but cover the whole
field.

"We need to do whatever we can that's legal to investigate
and disrupt," he added.

Today, it is believed that only a handful of the two dozen
material witnesses, perhaps as few as two, are still being
detained.

But the process of detaining the witnesses has stirred
intense criticism.

Last April, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District
Court in Manhattan ruled that the use of the law "to detain
people who are presumed innocent under our Constitution in
order to prevent potential crimes is an illegitimate use of
the statute."

Judge Scheindlin said the material witness law applied when
witnesses were held to give testimony at trials, not for
grand jury investigations. "Since 1789," Judge Scheindlin
said, "no Congress has granted the government the authority
to imprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that
he will testify before a grand jury conducting a criminal
investigation."

Then last month, Chief Judge Michael B. Mukasey, also of
Federal District Court in Manhattan, upheld the
government's use of the material witness statute in grand
jury investigations, criticizing Judge Scheindlin's
reasoning.

Judge Mukasey, citing the assertion in 1807 by Chief
Justice John Marshall that "the public has a right to every
man's evidence," held that detentions of material witnesses
during investigations are proper.

The War Captives

No Lawyers Allowed
Under U.S. Label

Yasser Esam Hamdi, a
Saudi national who was captured in Afghanistan, is probably
an American citizen by virtue of having been born in
Louisiana. His case represents the core issue of what kind
of role the nation's courts should have, if any, in
reviewing the government's imprisonment of someone charged
with something akin to a war crime.

Prosecutors will be back in Federal District Court in
Norfolk, Va., next Thursday to confront one of the federal
judges who has shown resistance to the government's
approach that once someone is declared an "enemy combatant"
by the president, all judicial review ceases.

Judge Robert G. Doumar, an appointee of President Reagan,
has twice ruled that Mr. Hamdi is entitled to a lawyer and
ordered the government to allow Frank Dunham, the federal
public defender, to be allowed to visit him without
government officials or listening devices. Judge Doumar
said that "fair play and fundamental justice" require it.
He said the government "could not cite one case where a
prisoner of any variety within the jurisdiction of a United
States District Court, who was held incommunicado and
indefinitely."

But the three-judge panel of the appeals court stayed Judge
Doumar's order, saying he had not fully considered the
government's needs to keep Mr. Hamdi incommunicado and,
more important, the executive branch's primacy in areas of
foreign and military affairs.

"The authority to capture those who take up arms against
America belongs to the commander in chief," Chief Judge J.
Harvie Wilkinson 3rd wrote for the appeals panel.

But even Judge Wilkinson seemed to evince some surprise at
the breadth of what the government was asserting when he
asked the Justice Department's lawyer, "You are saying that
the judiciary has no right to inquire at all into someone's
stature as an enemy combatant?"

The government has relented slightly, agreeing to provide
the court with a sealed declaration of the criteria by
which they have judged Mr. Hamdi to be an enemy combatant.
But the government has argued that judges cannot argue with
the standards.

Judge Doumar has indicated that he will question the
government closely on those standards.

The case of Jose Padilla, which has not progressed as far
as that of Mr. Hamdi, may present an even greater challenge
to normal judicial procedures.

Mr. Padilla, also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, is, like
Mr. Hamdi, an American citizen, imprisoned in a naval brig
after having been declared an enemy combatant. But unlike
Mr. Hamdi, Mr. Padilla was not arrested on the battlefield
by the military but on United States soil by civil law
enforcement authorities, on May 8 in Chicago.

After his detention as a material witness based on
suspicions that he was seeking to obtain material and
information to build a radioactive bomb, he was transferred
to military custody.

"This is the model we all fear or should fear," said Mr.
Dunham, the public defender. "The executive branch can
arrest an American citizen here and then declare him an
enemy combatant and put him outside the reach of the
courts. They can keep him indefinitely without charging him
or giving him access to a lawyer or presenting any
evidence."

Internet Defamation Suit Ends With Defense Verdict

http://www.law.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/View&c=LawArticle&cid=1028320303259&t=LawArticleTech

John Council
Texas Lawyer 08-05-2002

In one of the first trials in the country to
address Internet defamation, a Dallas County,
Texas, jury last week rejected a $700 million
suit by an Internet company that claimed it
was harmed by negative electronic messages
posted by an employee of a competing company.

ZixIt, a Dallas Internet company, filed ZixIt
Corp. v. Visa International, et al. in 1999,
alleging it was harmed by Paul Guthrie, then
a vice president with Visa. ZixIt alleged in
its suit that Guthrie posted more than 400
anonymous messages, many of them negative,
about ZixIt on the Yahoo Finance ZixIt Internet
message board, causing ZixIt's stock price to
drop.

The suit also alleged that the postings
destroyed the company's ability to market
its ZixCharge Internet transaction
authorization system, which allows consumers
to make purchases without revealing their
credit card numbers to merchants. Visa has
a similar Internet payment system.

ZixIt alleged that the postings caused its
stock price to plummet. Had the product
been successful, the company believed it
would have been worth more than $1 billion,
according to lawyers involved in the case.

On July 31, a jury in Judge Merrill Hartman's
192nd District Court found that ZixIt's
product was not harmed by the postings.

Neal Manne and Kenneth McNeil, lawyers from
Houston's Susman Godfrey who represented
ZixIt at trial, did not return calls for
comment by press time.

"The company hasn't made any decision about
an appeal," says Cindy Lawrence, a ZixIt
spokeswoman. "The outcome of the lawsuit
doesn't have any effect on our future
products and services in e-messaging."

GETTING GRADED

Visa's lawyers alleged that Guthrie acted on
his own and had a right to free speech, and
that Guthrie's Internet postings had no
effect on ZixIt's stock. Guthrie has since
left Visa, lawyers for the company say.
Guthrie was not a defendant in the case.
However, his interests in the case were
represented by Todd Noonan, an attorney in
Sacramento, Calif.'s Stevens & O'Connell.
Noonan was recovering from surgery last
week and was unavailable for comment.

"I think people believe whether you
succeed or fail [is] because of what you
do and not what other people do to you.
Internet companies didn't succeed for all
sorts of reasons," says Jeff Tillotson, a
partner in Dallas' Lynn, Tillotson & Pinker,
who defended Visa at trial.

ZixIt's case was a hard sell to the jury,
especially with the reality of the economy,
Tillotson says.

"Everyone knows that the stock market
has fallen and the trouble with Internet
companies. I think the jury took that into
account," Tillotson says.

There were lessons to be learned from the
Internet defamation trial, says Mike Lynn,
who also represented Visa at trial. Even
though message boards are considered a
protected form of free speech, that freedom
won't prevent a company from being dragged
into court if its employee blasts another
company on the Internet, Lynn says.

"A company can be responsible for what an
employee posts on a message board," Lynn
says. "The courts have said you're entitled
to go to a jury to determine whether there
are damages as a result of that. The law is
very odd, not mature, [and] damage theories
are not mature."

The nature of the case also added an
interesting twist to the trial, Tillotson
says. Many of those who posted messages on
the board attended the trial and posted
comments about the daily proceedings
throughout the three-week trial, he says.

"It was apparent to everyone that many of
the people who posted on these message boards
were watching the trial," Tillotson says.
"It really was wild. The lawyers felt like
they were being graded."

Well, I've used the check-the-modify-time cache trick for files in
many places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks it
is effective. However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint
state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current
folder on every message read? Perhaps we look at the sequences file
more than once per message view? Just idle speculation - we can
stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are.

Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log.
We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 -
Tcl has had "clock seconds" (like gettimeofday) and "clock clicks"
(high resolution timer) for some time. But in 8.3 we've calibrated
clock clicks values to microseconds. It is still only useful for
relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond
delta since the last log record. Of course, we are measuring all
the overhead of taking the log record, etc. I'll try it out.

Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the
context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.

In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify
time,
but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to
check their date stamp, you could just read them again.

Do you really think this is true? I added a modify time check thinking
that
it would make an improvement since we were reading it a *lot* more times
in
the new code because we're trying to use the sequences.

On the other hand, the sequences files are probably being read out of
cache
when that happens anyway.

Even with a small file, I'd think that the time taken to do a
[file mtime $filename] would be worth it. My code is in proc
MhReadSeqs.

As I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences file
first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence. This
happens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in Ftoc_ShowSequences.
That seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my abstraction to
have a separate call for "what sequences are in this folder?" and "what
messages are in this sequence?". One option would have been to add another
call to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the check-the-modify-time
technique would be less error-prone.

I think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to allow
a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the
current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences
for all messages. I described these thoughts in an email message yesterday.

And again, if it can wait a few weeks, I'm willing to do it.

So I see a headline which reads:

if West Jerusalem should worry that
Redmond will beat them to embracing
the West Bank.

http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

Begeman's _Manufacturing Processes_
talks about Quality Control Charts:

The tolerance limits for a part are placed outside of the control
limits and are never inside of them. Once the control chart has
been established, data is recorded on it and it becomes a record
of the variation of an inspected dimension over a period of time.
The data plotted should fall in random fashion between the control
lines, if all assignable causes for variation are absent. When the
data fall in this manner, it can be assumed that the part is being
made correctly 99.73% of the time; that is, no more than 3 out of
1000 will leave the process incorrectly made.

Taking a look at the S&P 500, and
using the Ibbotson 2000 figures of
13% expected stock return and 20%
standard deviation, and taking the
the actual 2.5 year return on the
S&P since 31 Dec 1999 to be close
to -30%, we find:

-.30 ? 2.5*(.13) - 3*sqrt(2.5)*(.20)
-30% > -60%

so it still plots out between the
control lines ...

So long as the points fall between the control lines, no adjustments
or changes in the process are necessary. If five to seven points fall
on one side of the mean, the process should be checked. When points
fall outside of the control lines, the cause must be located and
corrected immediately.

... but maybe we should've checked
the process during the "long" bull.

As I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences
file
first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence. This

happens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in
Ftoc_ShowSequences.
That seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my
abstraction to
have a separate call for "what sequences are in this folder?" and "what
messages are in this sequence?". One option would have been to add
another
call to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the
check-the-modify-time
technique would be less error-prone.

I like the check-the-modify-time technique.

I think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to
allow
a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that
the
current code would only be run when we really do have to update all
sequences
for all messages. I described these thoughts in an email message
yesterday.

And again, if it can wait a few weeks, I'm willing to do it.

OK - I've yet to dive into the latest round of changes, but I plan to.
I can say I'll make any progress, but I may dabble. Thanks again for
all your work in this area. Generalized sequence support has been on
my to do list for about 8 years.

Group proposes PC protection guarantees

Several U.S. government agencies have teamed with an international Internet security organization to support a set of
benchmarks aimed at guaranteeing a minimum security standard for computers. While Windows 2000 workstations are
the first benchmark that the disparate organizations have agreed upon, others to follow include Cisco IOS for
routers, Solaris, Linux and HP-UX. Reaching agreement on these benchmarks will not be a walk in the park.

Microsoft squashes Windows 2000 bugs

As the rhetoric turns

Last year, Steve Ballmer called the GPL on which Linux is based a "cancer." This year, Linux is a "unique
competititor." The emergence of Linux as a serious competitor to Windows has forced Microsoft to change the way it
approaches customers, Microsoft's CEO acknowledged at this week's Fusion 2002. Microsoft traditionally has played its "low price, high volume" game against IBM, Oracle and others. Now it must figure out how to beat Linux, which has an even lower cost -- free.

Wi-Fi can wait

The next iteration of Wi-Fi (aka 802.11a) may be getting a lot of interest, but rolling it out now, says Gartner, would be jumping
the gun. The anointed successor to the 802.11b modulation scheme provides up to five times the throughput over its predecessor. When will it be ready for prime time?

What is MIME?

MIME stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It is the
standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the
world-wide Internet email system. Typical uses of MIME include sending
images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text
files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part
of the file. MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a
recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them.

How can I read a MIME message?

Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use
which do not understand MIME messages. However, there are a growing
number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in. (One popular
MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the
University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host
ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)

In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation
capability in their Internet gateway products. However, even if you do
not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is
still hope!

There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME
message. One of the more versatile is called "munpack". It was developed
at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the
host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/. There are versions
available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems. For compabibility with
older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also
decode messages in split-uuencoded format.

Does MIME replace UUENCODE?

Yes. UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so
that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical
limitations and interoperability problems. MIME uses a more robust
encoding called "Base64" which has been carefully designed to survive the
message transformations made by certain email gateways.

How can I learn more about MIME?

The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via
anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including:

o US East Coast
Address: ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)

o US West Coast
Address: ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)

o Pacific Rim
Address: munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)

o Europe
Address: nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17)

Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt

Another source of information is the Internet news group "comp.mail.mime",
which includes a periodic posting of a "Frequently Asked Questions" list.

2 things - first, the switch parser changed in a subtle way with 8.4 -
byte-code compilation was added, and it is slightly more strict in
its parsing than the original parser. You can only have a comment where
Tcl would expect to find a command. Switch has a "pattern - body"
strucutre, so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find
a pattern, both of you will be confused with the results. The
subtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines. I can't give you
the exact case, but I know exmh had one example that stopped parsing
correctly, and was arguably wrong before.

2nd - I've managed to remain fairly ignoranat of the PGP support in
exmh, so you'll have to dig in yourself or see if someone else on
exmh-users or exmh-workers is having similar problems.

Partial solution.
And this MAY be related to using tcl/tk 8.4b1, as I had a similar
problem about a month ago elsewhere in EXMH (which you found).

But first.
I really feel like something has changed out from under me
with my making no changes to EXMH. Namely, when I first got
GPG up and working (for reading signatures) all I did was
touch the 'Check Signature' button' and it went out and queried
the keyserver for me.
Now Im getting a separate box, after the failure to find the
public key on my keyring, asking me of I want to 'Query keyserver'

I KNOW that I never had to touch a 'Query keyserver' button in
the past, but there it is now, and I havent touched EXMH. Spooky.

I have been working back and forth between GPG 1.0.6 and 1.0.7
but its not clear how that could be the problem, as Im now getting
the 'Query' message when running either...

---

OK, enough about my confusion.
The CURRENT problem seems to be a COMMENT in a SWITCH statement
at line 86 in pgpWWW.tcl. Tcl 8.4b1 doesnt like it and I get your
popup box. Remove it and no popupbox, but EXMH hangs (sigh).
So, not a complete solution, but at least a start.

Thanks for the interest.

I use exmh 2.5 with procmail for presorting incoming mail and move it to
the relevant folder using rcvstore.

Recently, my incoming mail (or spool) location moved to another disk.
I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept
mail from the new location.

There seems to be a variable in exmh-defaults (bgspool). It says at the
top of the file not to edit these lines. So, I went ahead and edited it :-)
That does not make a difference.

It seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from
my spool/incoming mail area and piping it to rcvstore. So, I need to
configure that probably.

Any idea how I would do this?

Thanks
Siva

Recently, my incoming mail (or spool) location moved to another disk.
I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept
mail from the new location.

How do you feed procmail? Not with a .forward, I'd guess.

How does mail enter your system anyway? Per fetchmail maybe? Or direct
SMTP-delivery? Or does it just magically hit your spool?

Lotsa questions...

Is there a way to do a global Sort command? Here's the situation: I like to
sort by date every folder. I'm cleaning up my inbox from most recent to oldest,
since I find this direction most efficient (I guess because it helps me
recognize the significance of individual, old messages). But this adds messages
to my other folders in the wrong order. When I'm done, I'd like to re-sort all
the folders I've changed.

Sounds like the land of UNIX for the PC (Politically Correct) still has
some ways to go in becoming UNIX for the Rest of Us...

Quoted from Mac OS X man page for sudoers(5):

insults If set, sudo will insult users when they enter
an incorrect password. This flag is off by
default.

Hey, at least Apple set the default to no-insults! :-)

I don't understand. How does sorting one folder add messages to
other folders? What do you use to sort?

Has anyone had much positive experience with PKI based smartcards, email
(S/Mime interoperability), programming to smart cards, etc.?

One area in particular that seems surprising is that a number of
projects are using cards like the Datakey 330 which seems to store data
in a way that is proprietary to particular card/reader driver versions.

I've been told, on the other hand, that Java PKI smart cards are very
interchangable and upward compatible. The only reasons I've been able
to find so far for using the more 'proprietary' cards is that they may
be cheaper and further along in FIPS validation.

Sorry I wasn't clear. I am transferring messages from my inbox to other folders
and since I am doing it from most recent to oldest, they appear in those
folders in the wrong order and need re-sorting.

OK, gotcha.

I don't think you can do that with exmh, but you can do it on the
command line, if you use sh or ksh:

for f in `folders -fast -r`
do
echo sorting $f ...
sortm +$f
done

It could take a long time.

At work, I have to use Outlook. Ick. I hate it. But it does a few
things right. Like making indices for each folder, and not just by
date, but also by sender, message size, subject. So I can sort by any
column instantly.

I believe this is possible, too, with an IMAP compliant reader,
provided the IMAP server makes such indices.

I am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry
standards. I use it for my personal mail. My mail server runs unix,
and I connect over ssh and tunnel my X traffic over ssh. With a slow
link, this makes exmh very slow. And mime handling is pretty bad
compared with modern mailers. I am just scared to move. I've been
using MH or nmh since 1985 and exmh since 1995. 17 years is a long
time!

Mail Me the Money!
By David Friedman 08/08/2002

David is a very bright fellow. But this time he's
several years behind. The idea of using epostage
to stop spam has been discussed quite a bit. The
problem is how to get over the adoption hump.
Until most people are taking one form of epostage,
most people don't have enough incentive to download
and install something that allows them to pay it.
Until most people are set up to pay it, any form of
epostage I require closes my mailbox to unknown
senders from whom I want to receive mail. And even
from known senders. Giving someone my email address
doesn't automatically put them in my white list.

Hashcash tries to lower the adoption barrier by
removing the need to pay money for epostage.
Instead, the sender burns processing time on his
computer, answering a cryptographically hard
challenge. But even this requires set-up. There is
inadequate incentive to do so until there is a
standard mechanism, but no standard mechanism is
born until a significant fraction of the market
has taken that first step. It may take government
action, to institute an effective epostage
standard!

I think the better idea is to require that people
off your white list "hand sign" email to you. A
couple of companies are now trying to implement
this. An email sender, if not on your white list,
must respond to a verification email or go to a
website, by a process that is very simply for a
human sender, but difficult for a spammer to
automate. Where epostage requires a standard
mechanism, a variety of mechanisms for "hand
signing" would frustrate spammers while making it
no more difficult for legitimate senders. I'm
hoping Eudora and some of the other big mail
clients incorporate this kind of feature. The
advantage to putting this in the mail client is
that the required "hand sign" can be personalized:

"Your attempt to email David Friedman is
blocked until you fill in the blank: The
Incredible ______ Machine."

It will be a long time before spammers have a
process that defeats millions of personal
challenges. On the other hand, I have a hack in
mind that would work a large percentage of the
time. But I'm not telling. If spammers did figure
out such hacks, people would then improve their
challenges. Yeah, this would lead to another
arms race, and spam would leak through to the
unwitting. But this arms race is one that helps
spammers identify and target the part of the
population whose challenges are sub-par, which
is their natural prey. People like David aren't
in the market for herbal Viagra or back alley
debt consolidation.

Since David is an anarchist, I'm surprised he
didn't point out that spam is the result of
government. The government is ineffective at
preventing spam, but it DOES prevent individuals
and ISPs from taking retribution against spammers.

Gaim Changelog
http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ChangeLog

Gaim is an instant messaging client based on the published TOC
protocol from AOL. The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client
that combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the
hyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an
untrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting,
permitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users
machine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the
user clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't
vulnerable.

The fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser
command to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will
need to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes. The 'Manual'
browser command can be edited in the 'General' pane of the
'Preferences' dialog, which can be accessed by clicking 'Options' from
the login window, or 'Tools' and then 'Preferences' from the menu bar
in the buddy list window.

Please download Gaim 0.59.1 or later using Red Carpet. You may also
obtain this update from the Ximian FTP site.

Wanting to sort like that is not common; I'd be surprised if exmh has
a widget for it. You can achieve what you want with the command-line
mh tools, though.
I suggest doing the following from a shell prompt:

sh -c 'for f in "`folders -recurse -fast`" ; do sortm +"$f" ; done'

(The command "sortm" will sort a particular folder, and
"folders -recurse -fast" prints out a list of all of your folders.)

I hope this helps,

I started using linux about 8 or 9 years ago in rebellion against what the university was doing with Winder$. I just couldn't get good support and was using a lot of unix-based tools (ported to Winder$) anyway. So, I jumped ship and became my own sysadm.

What I got was the easy ability to use a shell (now ssh) to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh (from the command line). I can do email for the office fairly easily.

I haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet. But, I have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close. Quoting and such is still primitive, but they're moving forward.

I don't think there is a specific word in English for eye goop.
However, when I was halfway literate in Tagalog, I learned that there is
a specific word in that language (or was it another dialect?) for it:
muta, pronounced "MOO-ta". Even though my Tagalog has faded greatly, I
automatically use that word for "eye goop" when speaking English (how
often does that happen?), mostly because it apparently filled a
linguistic hole in my brain and therefore permanently wedged itself into
my vocabulary.

Not that this is important, but I've inadvertently adopted "muta" into
my version of the English language as the word for "eye goop". Arguably
better than "smegma" anyway.

This paper presents a new generation of attacks against Microsoft
Windows, and possibly other message-based windowing systems. The
flaws presented in this paper are, at the time of writing,
unfixable. The only reliable solution to these attacks requires
functionality that is not present in Windows, as well as efforts on
the part of every single Windows software vendor. Microsoft has
known about these flaws for some time; when I alerted them to this
attack, their response was that they do not class it as a flaw -
the email can be found here. This research was sparked by comments
made by Microsoft VP Jim Allchin who stated, under oath, that there
were flaws in Windows so great that they would threaten national
security if the Windows source code were to be disclosed. He
mentioned Message Queueing, and immediately regretted it. However,
given the quantity of research currently taking place around the
world after Mr Allchin's comments, it is about time the white hat
community saw what is actually possible.

Wanting to sort like that is not common; I'd be surprised if exmh has
a widget for it. You can achieve what you want with the command-line
mh tools, though.
I suggest doing the following from a shell prompt:

sh -c 'for f in "`folders -recurse -fast`" ; do sortm +"$f" ; done'

(The command "sortm" will sort a particular folder, and
"folders -recurse -fast" prints out a list of all of your folders.)

Thanks Tom and Jacob. The above works, but without the double quotes: i.e.

sh -c 'for f in `folders -recurse -fast` ; do sortm +"$f" ; done'

I'd attach this command to the sorting menu if I knew any tcl...

I may have a different version of "sh" than you do; the double quotes
around the backticks work for my "sh".

(In the more-than-you-really-wanted-to-know category, you're probably
safe without the double quotes. The only reason I put them in is that
I have some pathologically-named folders, including folders whose
names contain spaces. If all your folders have safe names, you don't

This only restates the assertion, it doesn't clarify /how/ government
restrains you, other than under laws of criminal conduct and violent
crimes (if you meant the above literally)

If I can trace a spammer to their ISP, I can /generally/ get that
account revoked, and if you trace one to their parent corporation, I
don't know of any law that specifically /exempts/ them from lawsuits,
it's just that no one has yet succeeded in any important way. If you
have some law that prevents action against spammers, then why all the
class-action suits and other anti-spam court cases, some even
state-funded?

I'm also curious of the mechanics of your retribution strategy: Let's
say you did win a lawsuit and shut down the largest spammer network in
the USA, do you really believe 40 Beijing spammers won't fill the
void? Do you really believe those 40 are not right now prepping their
mail servers whether or not you prevail over your countrymen? How do
you intend to take legal (and/or violent) action against people a
world away and in a culture you can barely understand let alone
understand how to properly bribe?

I'm not so hopeful this method can work against aromatherapy viagra
when we can't even track and convict murderous Nigerian mafia, and
they are blatant! Political solution is a contradiction in terms, and
it's also true that no lawmaker has ever been even a tenth the
catalyst on improving the quality of life in Britain and the western
world as did central heating and the invention of one A.J.Crapper.

I've got a few quick Lockergnome-related notes for you today.

First, we'd really like to see you in August. I know that Jake, Chris and Randy have been signing off on their newsletters with those few words, and I'll join them. If you didn't experience Gnomedex last year, you missed, in the words of many industry insiders, "The show of the year." It was unlike any other computer conference I've ever attended. Unlike any conference I've attended, period, computer-related or not. While most such conferences are a huge hustle and hassle, Gnomedex was what computing and Lockergnome are all about - sharing useful information, gathering with like-minded enthusiasts, and learning to use your chosen computer to the fullest extent. No hustle. No hassle. No BS. For the minimal cost of registration, it would be hard to find a better weekend for geeks and wannabes alike. Add to that the schedule of luminaries presenting and attending and you've got the best deal on the planet for computer users. It's hard to believe we're less than a month away - I really do hope to see you there.

Another Lockergnome innovation has hit the newsstands - err, bookstores. That's right. Jake has release a FREE GnomeTome on "Converting Vinyl LPs to CD." Who'd have thought there were so many of you out there that are, well, my age and still in possession of those black slabs of aural heaven. I don't know if Jake's just lost his mind, or what, but free? Get outta here. Go ahead - "Gnome" our servers. Get you copy while you can. And while you're there, check out some of the other killer e-tip books in the GnomeTomes collection.

Have a great Tuesday.

Setting the Home Page in Konqueror

Konqueror, while a great browser, has taken a step in the direction of IE. Like IE, Konqueror is really an integrated web and file browser. You can use it equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been something of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a browser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question - it's a web browser and a web broswer only.

Regardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror browser and end up in your /home/user directory. Have no fear, though. It's an easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror.

Open Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select "Configure Konqueror," and leave the default selection of "File Manager" as is. In the text box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the "Home URL" text box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the home URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home page. Select OK to close the window.

Taking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser to open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select "Window" and "Save View Profile, 'Web Browsing.'" This will futher save the URL and allow your the opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens.

Konqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it act like a pure web browser if you just know where to look.

Kernel Configuration - Part XII

Depending on who you talk to, RAID can stand for "Redundant Array of Independent Discs" or "Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs." No matter. They both point to the same theory and practice in Linux; data storage redundancy. That's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support.

Let's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple discs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally, there are 5 levels of RAID in Linux; Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and RAID-5.

Linear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In other words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no redundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further, there's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one drive in the RAID array at a time.

RAID-0 "stripes" data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the first drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no redundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives, not all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0 will, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly.

RAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0, does provide data redundancy. This is the first level in which data is "mirrored" across the drives in the RAID array. All data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at least two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall RAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can actually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is written across multiple discs.

RAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for parity information while striping the data across the others. This is much like Linear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data can be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but this really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is probably the least used of the RAID schemes.

RAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed. Like RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than reserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the array. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can be accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a "spare disc" configuration will allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after the failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5 is probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices.

With all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel configuration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to configure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel configuration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the RAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate option.

Tomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.

Windows Apps in Linux?
Scribbled by Robert Nix

"Nice coverage but I don't give a flip about Office. OpenOffice is fine
for my needs.

"What I really want is to run Quicken (at least v.2001) which is the only
app keeping me running Windows (using vmware). I've tried Quicken on Mac
OS X and it is grossly inadequate and on Linux with Wine and have so far
been unsuccessful even using tips from
http://appdb.codeweavers.com/appview.php?appId=107. I hope that GnuCash
will eventually support the online features I enjoy but that doesn't
help now.

"The reason I'm writing this is that I personally think Office products
are overrated for home users, at least now that there are several native
alternatives. For home users, finance apps are the key issue now. Do a

Important Unix Manpages

Manpages are an important part of Linux use. Armed with the proper knowledge and manpage, there are few sticky situations in Linux that can't be solved quickly. Though they can be a bit cryptic at times, manpages are really a Linux newbie's best friend.

Important Unix Manpages is a compilation of help for situations that actually have little to do with programming. They're more human interface problems than machine interface problems. This page just points out that if life was like Linux, we'd all be a lot happier.

Ahh. At work we fire people who use Outlook (Literally true: They get

Why? What threat does Outlook pose to your organization?

But it does a few things right. Like making indices for each folder,
and not just by date, but also by sender, message size, subject. So I
can sort by any column instantly.

Have you looked into using a custom sequences file?

More detail please? I do use sequences, so I'm familiar with their
use, but how can I make indices with them, and how can I keep them
up to date?

And mime handling is pretty bad compared with modern mailers.

The only thing I actually miss in that regard is support for S/MIME.

You're probably running exmh on a local machine. I'm running it on
a very remote machine. In this scenario, the mime handling is weak.

How do you intend to take legal (and/or violent) action against people a
world away and in a culture you can barely understand let alone
understand how to properly bribe? I'm not so hopeful this method can work
against aromatherapy viagra when we can't even track and convict murderous
Nigerian mafia, and they are blatant!

Spammers fall into two categories. The more
difficult case are those whose back-end business
can be executed entirely in a foreign nation, such
as the 419 spammers. And you're right: there's not
much we can do about those, except filter them in
various ways. But the vast majority of spammers
have a back-end business that requires a native
presence. Debt consolidation. Mortgages. Herbalife
and other MLMs. Even porn sites require credit
card transactions. That means the people responsible
CAN be found.

I don't know of any law that specifically /exempts/ them from lawsuits,
it's just that no one has yet succeeded in any important way.

There have been some successful suits, but (a) it
takes too much effort, and (b) the result isn't enough
to deter the spammer. But you're talking about action
constrained by law. In an anarchy, people act more
directly, with less cost, and to more effect. Spammers
very quickly would learn their lesson. Except for the
ones who ply their scam in a foreign country.

Of course, that's assuming there are ISPs and other
infrastructure in an anarchy. Arguing about how things
would work without the state involves a large degree
of counterfactual reasoning.

no lawmaker has ever been even a tenth the catalyst on improving the
quality of life in Britain and the western world as did central heating and
the invention of one A.J.Crapper.

Hmm. I've lived most of my life in houses that did
not have central heating, including my current abode.
As to the crapper, it did not do nearly as much to
improve waste management in cities as did the public
sewers which it feeds, and the water lines that supply
it. Without these, you would find that a chamber pot
works just as well.

It places the company, corporate network and data at risk.

Outlook is subject to an (absurdly large) number of exploits with more
being regularly found. An exploited system, to whatever extent, places
other corporate systems at risk, customer systems at risk, company
reputation and liability with customers at risk, and
proprietary/corporate data at risk. Further, users cannot be reliably
expected to use Outlook in a safe manner. The net result is that
Outlook use is considered to be somewhere between criminal negligence
and deliberately malicious as far as the employer is concerned.

Have you looked into using a custom sequences file?

More detail please? I do use sequences, so I'm familiar with their
use, but how can I make indices with them, and how can I keep them up
to date?

I don't use custom sequences, so I can't comment well. I suspect that
you'd have to use a cron job to maintain the sequences.

The only thing I actually miss in that regard is support for S/MIME.

You're probably running exmh on a local machine. I'm running it on a

Nope. I run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting
exmh windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops (gratis
SSH X11 forwarding). In fact, your message was read and replied to
(this message) while at work, using an exmh instance running on my home

Here is the little script I run I run nightly from cron. It does a

I didn't write it and I'm afraid I have lost track of who did, but
it's worked well for years. I run a similar one to update the glimpse

My ideal mailwall will allow message passthrough in many ways:

- Sender membership on my personal whitelist or any one of
many other external whitelists I respect
- Payment of a small fee (via a website and PayPal link)
- Demonstration of special per-message effort, either
via...
- a computational challenge (hashcash)
or
- other challenge that requires human-level flexibility &
followthrough (sender manual whitelisting)
- Inclusion of a legally-enforceable guarantee that the
mail is not an unsolicited commercial pitch -- one
example of this class of guarantee would be a posted
bond
- By convincing some analysis software agent of mine that
I want to see the mail, based on its content and
distribution list

There's no need to do only one. Some might overlap; the manual
process for passing a message through might require the assertion
of a legally-enforceable guarantee about the messages' contents.
Passing certain tests once might add an address to the persistent
whitelist.

Any slightly determined and legitimate correspondent would be
able to find multiple ways to get their mail read, while spammers
would face a situation where the marginal cost of reaching me
is much, much greater than the expected return.

Some economically irrational spammers (and religious/political
zealots) would get through, but such traffic should be a
background trickle rather than an annoying torrent.

Nope. I run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting
exmh windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops (gratis

I run exmh routinely from home (broadband) using an XWindows Client tunneled through ssh under WinXP. It works very well in this fashion.

FWIW, I use Eudora under Winder$ because it's less of a virus magnet. :)

There's more to the story why I run Winder$, but that's really off-topic and I'm already guilty!

There is an "Update all scan caches" menu entry that rescans your

Gary Lawrence Murphy:
This is for the whitelist fans: Can someone please tell us why the
following extremely frequent spam header pattern would _not_ pass a
whitelist test? The letter itself is most certainly spam/viral and
was most certainly not sent by me, but I see no way you might tell that it
was not, nor can I see how I might charge the sender with fraud for having
'impersonated' my account. .. My uneducated guess is that all they need to
jump expensive whitelist
walls would be buckshot a spam-laden Klez ..

There are several issues here.

(1) For reasons that have nothing to do with
commercial advertising, we need email software that
prevents virus attacks a la Melissa and Klez. We
simply can't continue down the path where every
script kiddie with a grudge or political agenda can
cause millions or billions of dollars worth of
damage.

(2) Very likely, email practices will evolve to the
point that digital signatures are the standard way
to recognize the sender of a message. Sabotaging
your machine or otherwise compromising your private
key will be the only way that someone can forge a
message from you. I don't see any reason that email
software that automatically uses digital signatures
for contact management and whitelisting would be
any more expensive than existing email clients.
Unless Microsoft manages to get a defacto monopoly
on it.

(3) I think identity theft should be made a felony,
with very stiff penalties, for reasons that have
nothing to do with spam. No, obviously, simply
parading around with a sign that says "I'm George
Bush" is not identity theft. On the other hand,
I think using a virus to compromise someone else's
private key should should fall into that category.

Thanks Brent: now it's clearer (to me) what's needed. I've used the global
sort and J C Lawrence's re-scan, but there is still a vulnerability there:
If I have an instance of exmh running, the folder I'm visiting will have
its new, correct .xmhcache overwritten with an incorrect one when I switch
folders. I can cron the sort and re-scan process, but I should kill running
exmh's first.

Best would be to have a button for "Global sort and update all scan caches"
in the exmh More... menu

If you crypto-sign your outgoing mail, you don't have to set
your mailwall whitelist to accept unsigned mail spoofed as being
from you.

Similarly, if you include some weaker token or checksum that
spammers can't easily guess.

If you can track the actual sender, then the proof that they've
committed identity fraud is your credible testimony that you
are the rightful user of the declared originating address, and
that you did not send the message. I'm not sure what level of
damages you could claim, though.

Yes.

One of the nicer aspects of exmh's colour handling is that while I have
the default background for the message pane set to black, the second
insance of exmh displaying to a given $DISPLAY will set the background
of the message pane to darkslategray. Very nice as it provides an

Whether you've been using it for a while or are planning to upgrade to the new OS soon, this ebook is right up your alley. GET YOUR COPY of Lockergnome's Top 50 Windows XP tips now!

I don't go to many concerts, but that doesn't mean I don't
appreciate listening to good
music at every waking moment. Tonight, a handful of Bay
Gnomies and I watched They Might Be Giants rock the Fillmore.
Melanie, Steve, Brent, Missy, Robert, Patrick, Gretchen, Matt, and
Mindy had a total blast. Well, it wasn't much fun when Robert got
his digital camera confiscated - but this was a show worthy of
five megapixels
(believe me)! Brent went to
the show last night, and I saw them play on the set earlier this
afternoon. They were selling a new CD (which had JUST been
released the other day); "They Got Lost" is full of a few
previously-unavailable tracks. If you aren't sure about purchasing
it outright, I strongly urge you to sign up for a trial EMusic account and download
a few of their songs in MP3 format. Oh, and check out the opening
act: Noe Venable. She's got
a few free MP3s on
her site, too. Give "Boots" a shot - very nice.

Does anybody know how to set a binary clock? Melanie got it for me
as a gift (which was a very nice gesture). Sure, I could read the
manual - but the ones and zeros start to look eerily similar after
flipping past the first page. You know me: I'm not much of a math
guy. In fact, I just discovered the other day that 'byte' was
short for 'by eight' (even though I already knew that 'bit'
represented 'binary digit'). I'd stick with a digital timepiece,
but it just isn't geeky enough for me anymore. How sad is that?
I'm ready to walk on the wild side. Maybe I'll get my laptop
pierced tomorrow? It could happen. I've been known to do nutty
things on a moment's notice, like changing my default Web browser.
Courtesy of Asa
Dotzler, I have an official Mozilla sticker, CD, and t-shirt
(which you saw me model in my Webcam the other day). Don't be too
jealous; Mozilla.org has
plenty of goodies to go around.

Looks as though Jake
and Lori are already having a blast in St. Louis.
They're at the Shareware Industry Conference, along with hundreds
of well-known program programmers - the people who make our
computers work the way we want them to work! We're doing our best
to convince them to join us at Gnomedex. They ask: "Who else
is going to be there?" We answer: "People who don't know you yet."
They ask: "Then why should I come?" We answer: "Because it's a
business opportunity for you." They ask: "What if I don't want to
learn anything or meet anybody?" We answer: "We can't really help
you there, but here - have lunch on us." They ask: "Oh, the
admission price includes food at at Gnomedex?" We answer: "We
cannot provide every meal, but you won't go hungry." They ask:
"So, why Des Moines, when there's nothing to do there." We answer:
"You're 100% wrong. There *IS* something to do there: Gnomedex."
Get it? Got it? Good.

http://users.bigpond.net.au/glina/GigAlarm.htm

{String on your finger} Sometimes, I'm a bit like the absent-minded professor... I would forget my own head if it wasn't attached. So naturally, I appreciate any program that can help keep me on track, and with GigAlarm I can setup whatever reminders/alarms I need. However, sometimes a simple text message just won't catch my attention. Well, herein lies the beauty of GigAlarm... it doesn't just have to give you a text alarm! GigAlarm can play a WAV file (random, or your selection), change your background, start a program, or use one of the many Windows shutdown options. My wife has gotten in the habit of using the Shutdown option as an alarm to signal that I have spent too long on the computer. (Lucky for me, there is a snooze button!) NOTE: The author says, "This program is essentially free to use for non-profit purposes... If you find this program useful I would appreciate $10 AUD (or $5 USD) as a token of your appreciation."

Context Thumbview v1.0.b1 [107k] W9x/2K/XP FREE

http://contextmagic.netfirms.com/image-viewer/

{Peep show} I'm not always very patient, especially when it comes to my computer. Double-clicking on an image and waiting for it to come up in my image viewer is almost too much for me to handle. Lucky for me, Context Thumbview has made its way onto my system and I no longer have to wait to view an image. All I do now is right-click the image, choose "View Thumbnail," and there is the image, out there for me to see... all without me having to open up any programs! "As Express ThumbView is an Explorer extension, it is always ready and available for use. Moreover, it is available in any Explorer window, including Open and Save As... dialog boxes." As an added bonus, with Context Thumbview installed on my system, I can also turn off the thumbnail view if I want to save system resources.

Starter v5.5.4.2175 [423k] W9x/2k/XP FREE

http://codestuff.tripod.com/

{Startup manager} This application bills itself as "Yet Another Startup Manager"... I don't think so! Starter isn't JUST another Startup Manager, it's a piece of programming art. One of my biggest problems with Windows Task Manager is that I don't know what all the processes on my machine are, or from where they are running. Starter not only gives me that information, but it also lets me save it as an HTML file. In addition, Starter lets me import and export registry keys or add a new task to be processed. Don't run all over your machine trying to find all the programs you need to control your PC, when you can do it all (and more!) with Starter.

Aversoft Sticker v3.55 [592k] W9x/2k/XP US$15
Unearthed by Sergei Lepyokhin

http://www.aversoft.com/sticker/

{Sticky notes} Did you know that Post-it(r) Notes were invented by accident? I use to have these notes all over my monitor. Now my screen is clean as a whistle! Aversoft Sticker is a program to help you remember "important information by displaying skinnable sticky notes on your Windows desktop." No more bland notes for me! With Sticker, I am surrounded with pictures of paradise (downloaded from Aversoft's website). These great features are no accident. Sticker also has a transparency feature that makes the notes only half visible, making it much easier to use while working on your other programs. Don't walk away yet though... Sticker also allows you to print your notes, lock them from accidentally being deleted, and set an alarm (repeating or one-time). Speaking of alarms, mine just went off and opened up Outlook. Time to send out today's newsletter!

GnomeTIP

Gnomies are known for their willingness to help others and Alex Warren is no exception with a tip on copying text. Alex writes: "Did you know that you can copy the contents of a message/dialog box just by pressing Ctrl+C?" Alex also had this to say: "When you select text and then use the mouse to drag it to a new location, the original text moves to the new location and disappears from the old location. However, you can select text and then use the right mouse button to drag it to a new location. When you do this, releasing the right mouse button opens a menu from which you can choose to move or copy the text (along with several other options)." Those are some great time saving tips Alex! Following suit with using Ctrl + C to copy... you can also use Ctrl + X to cut and Ctrl + V to paste. You can also use all these tips on more then just text! The next time you need to copy some files on your PC, try the right-click and drag method and you will see what I mean... along with saving yourself some time.

You seem to be saying that whitelists are useless, because there are worms
which can compromise your system, read your address book/whitelist, and
sent themselves on, compromising a nonnegligible fraction of systems as
they go along.

While mailing lists can be spam/worm amplifiers, I don't think this is
true for individual users even today. Moreover, worms which use email as
vector exist *only* because a single vendor ships mailers with broken
default settings, and insists to make documents executables. This makes
for very bad press, and eventually that vendor is going to wise up, and
stop shipping as many broken wares (or people will switch to more secure
alternatives, whatever comes first).

I run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting exmh
windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops (gratis SSH
X11 forwarding). In fact, your message was read and replied to (this
message) while at work, using an exmh instance running on my home
machine.

Just to throw in another approach to solving the same problem.

I run two copies of exmh, one at work, one at home. They both
display on a "virtual X server" created by vncserver on the home
box. I connect to that virtual X server using vncviewer wherever
I happen to be. The VNC connection is tunneled over ssh and is
carried over the Internet via an IPSEC appliance.

That gives me access to both home and work email from either
place without the complications involved in having two copies of
exmh working on the same set of folders.

It's a tad slow viewing work email when I'm at work ... but not
so bad that I can't stand it.

The way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (Preferences
-> Hacking Support -> Debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands
being issued and the responses.

FWIW, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 I do not have problems sending
encrypted messages to myself. When I select the message, an xterm
window pops up asking for the passphrase. I don't recall exmh ever
asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a
dialog box. (But then again, I'm not a heavy gpg user).

Hmm.. I've seen the *opposite* issue - if I go to *SEND* a signed message,
sometimes Exmh will put up the dialog box, but fail to set keyboard focus
there, so no passphrase can be entered. Of course, hitting 'return' doesnt
work so you need to click the 'OK' box, at which point it finds that the
passphrase that wasn't entered doesn't work, and asks again, this time with
proper focus set.

I suspect some variable/codepath is getting hosed for the focus, or possibly
some borkedness with --no-tty and/or --status-fd flags to gnupg.

The original comment's context was digital signatures. A digital signature
is worth sqrat if any userspace app or rogue superuser code can grab your
keyring in clear, and send out stuff in your name. A passphrase unlocking
the keyring for that particular use is a minimal protection (since not
immune to passphrase snarfers), but this is much, much better than always
leaving your key in the lock. (Why then having at all the key, in the
first place?)

key is as secure as any other data on your machine.
If you're working remotely, you already have to

A passphrase is a (long, secure) password unlocking (decrypting) your
keyring. You don't use a passphrase to read your email. Unless it resides
on a crypto file system.

Gotta wonder what the GPG config stuff in ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults looks
like. Also gotta wonder what the message headers in the offending
message are saying to nmh/exmh. My set-up works perfectly. That is,
I get a pop-up window to enter my passphrase into, and when I type it
correctly, the message display changes from a prompt to click to
decrypt to the message content.

If you have a rogue app on your machine, what
keeps it from sniffing your passphrase? This is
one of the reasons I keep harping on the need for
thin, secure clients.

A passphrase is a (long, secure) password unlocking (decrypting) your
keyring. You don't use a passphrase to read your email.

When I read email, I want to respond to email,
which means, were I using a digital signature,
that it needs to be at the ready.

Subject: [camram-spam] another framework hashcash related framework

There is a framework for using a hashcash like proof of work function
as a way to frustrate junk mailers in this paper:

"Curbing Junk E-Mail via Secure Classification"

by E. Gabber, M. Jakobsson, Y. Matias, A. Mayer Bell

in FC98.

Online copy here:

http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/27735.html

(Look in the view or download section at the top right, it's
availabile in at least .pdf and .ps formats).

The framework they propose with proxies etc looks a lot like the
current camram architecture, with a proof of work to get on a white
list. They use target revokable email addresses (basically identical
to the LWPA concept) to implement the white list.

The resulting framework is essentially identical to what I proposed in
recent message with:

Subject: target revokable email addresses, and postage-free tokens

Their idea of including the postage free-token in the email address,
mirrors what is done in LWPA and makes the system exhibit smoother
migration for non-users. eg. you can use varied sender addresses and
it will still work, you can forward the email address to someone else
and it will still work etc.

They have some software architecture diagrams and suggestions for
installing some of the proxies on a corporate gateway -- "gatekeeper"
they call it.

Clearly you've never met "Triumph", the Fabulous Crotch-Sniffing
Caymanian Customs Wonder Dog at extreme close range, or heard the
story about the expat's college age kid, actually born on Cayman, who
was literally exiled from the island when the island constabulary
"discovered" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break rental car
a few years back.

I mean, his old man was some senior cheese at Global Crossing at the
time, but this was back when they could do no wrong. If that's what
they did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former
junk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd
unauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty
keeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a
bottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting
nocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't
help thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman
van's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't
gonna be pretty.

Closer to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were
hustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on
Grand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple
of years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active
shooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a
few days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff,
reeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal
examinations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two,
courtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and
games with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog.
Heck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed
Caymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left.

Besides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their
activities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too
much in the way of "escaped" "revenue", or at least the perception of
same in the local "free" press. Obviously, if your money "there"
isn't exchangeable into your money "here", it kind of defeats the
purpose of keeping your money "there" in the first place, giving
folks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up
for renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line
credit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or
quango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and
the US.

As a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while
ago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom
on that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes
Luxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually
accessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans
themselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling
about one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing
pretexts.

At this point, the "legal", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings
are kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep
my money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where
a bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will
close it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned
statutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or
imagined property rights are this afternoon.

The point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only
solution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private
transactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than "transparent"
transactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real*
interesting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal
freedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and
groom action figures sold separately, of course.

As long as the OS doesn't give you a convenient GetPassPhrase() method

However, that's the reason I mentioned crypto hardware (USB fobs, smart

While this is a good idea, the concept of security is holistic. It
involves a secure OS, secure apps, and crypto hardware.

When I read email, I want to respond to email, which means, were I
using a digital signature, that it needs to be at the ready.

I believe I mentioned users can't be bothered to enter passphrases. That's

For a long time I have used an external editor with exmh (gvim).

I can cut'n'paste from exmh's message display window into spawned
gvim processes, but not into anything else.

This is VERY annoying.

(I have to look at the message with cat or less or whatever in a
terminal window if I want to do this - which is quite often. And
if the message is q-p encoded or a non-text/plain mime type, I end
up with all that raw garbage too).

Anyway to fix this?

*Political spam on your cell phone?*
By Lisa M. Bowman
Special to ZDNet News
August 22, 2002, 12:05 PM PT
URL: http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105-954909.html

*In a decision that treats text messaging on mobile phones essentially
the same as bumper stickers, the Federal Election Commission has
declared that senders of text-based political ads don't have to disclose
who funded them.*

In an advisory opinion issued Thursday, the FEC also suggested such
messages include either a phone number or Web site link, so people could
easily learn who paid for the message. However, the additional
information won't be required.

The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as
campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the
same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous
political spam.

Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had
asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring
financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would
use up too much of the 160 character-maximum.

Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from
the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was
supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular
Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade
groups.

FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the
commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the
potential to reach more voters.

"We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before
everyone understands how the technology is going to work," he said.

Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or
allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political
messages while remaining anonymous.

Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.

Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as
"good for America."

"It will allow people to receive more communication from those running
for office," he said. "We have free speech on our side."

I thought I baked my Dell PowerEdge 1400SC server yesterday
when it refused to boot completely. I borrowed a data vac
from a friend and decided to clean all of the dust and cat
hair from my systems, then after reconnecting everything,
the server would boot to the initial splash screen, where
there is a POST progress bar, but would not proceed past
past about the first 1/5th of the bar. Uh-oh. What did I
fry?

As it turns out, it was another case of "always check the
small stuff". Oh, I had all of the cables plugged back in to
the server properly, I checked all of that, but it didn't
dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later that
I should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the
cables. That server is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM
switch and with all of the yanking, plucking and shuffling,
the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the switch just a
tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning
message like every other computer on the planet, I can only
attribute to the BIOS developers. Server Satchel, running
Red Hat Linux 7.2 is now operating as it was previously. The
penguin is happy. The server case is even black. How
appropriate...

ATI Still Makes Video Cards?

http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1656

Say it isn't so! Yes, apparently they do still have
something to say about NVIDIA's dominance in the video card
market. Seeing as how they've been all but dumped by the
majority of top-tier system makers, it's hard to believe
that they are capable of a serious comeback. Judging from
what AnandTech has to say about the forthcoming R300-based
cards, it appears that they haven't thrown in the towel just
yet. I'm all for competition, so I welcome the effective re-
entrance into the high end market. Let's all hope that their
driver development has improved as much as their hardware
seems to have.

Technical Censorship

http://news.com.com/2100-1023-944315.html

Odd. I liked that cup of Mocha (spelled M-O-C-H-A and I'll explain in a minute) I drank at Starbucks when Jake and I visited last week, but if I wanted to relay that to someone using a Yahoo email account, you might see an alternate word. Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of you using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and the word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in drinks. They've also had a terrible time interpretting our W3C standardized HTML lately, dropping in copious #message references throughout the text in their new Beta email client. So why the text replacement? It's another filtering technique to stop certain words that might relate to JavaScript functions. I guess I'll have to choose another beverage next time. Silly me.

GnomeSTUFF

Yer Kidding... Really?

http://www.theregus.com/content/4/25629.html

I'm all sorts of sarcastic today, aren't I? Those of us
that have had to manage budgets are used to dealing with
math in terms of hardware, software, maintenance and
personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's
certainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of
Linux on a server with less hardware requirements just to do
some file sharing, printing and maybe an Intranet page or
three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very long last,
Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to
point out that they have much more to offer than Linux,
which may indeed be true. But at the end of the day, when
you compare donuts to donuts and like functions against one
another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained
staff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge,
requiring additional training, suffer the odd blunder here
and there, and be less forgiving when it comes to detailed
configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use
Windows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a
replacement. Cheap is in the budget of the beholder.

Recommend It!

Subject: Patch to complete a change...

I guess that most of us don't use "link" very often ... I noticed it
last week, but only got time to look and see why today.

I would like to use [Link] a lot more, but is it rather
inconvenient.

I have set my right mouse button to [Move] a message to another
folder, which works fine.

However, [Link] also uses the same destination folder as [Move], and
so if I want to use [Link] I first have to mark the destination
folder with a message-move, undo the move, then I can use the
[Link]. Very inconvenient.

Is there a better way for me to set this up so that [Link] works
with one or two simple clicks?

(In essence: is there a way to mark a destination folder for a
message link or move without actually doing a move or link, I
couldn't see anything obvious).

1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list

2) In the main window, the "+" key puts you into a "change
folder" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
hit a second + and you go to "set a target" mode. Type a few
characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.

Dunno.. Some of the new Sonys (I'm hunting again for a lappy, as the
Toshiba I have is a large piece of cow manure) which promise a 4 hour
battery life off of ONE battery are pretty damn impressive. As far as
the keyboard issue, the Toshiba actually came out with a good
keyboard, nearly equivalent to most standard keyboards (Not ergonomic,
alas, but I have a USB happy ergo keyboard I can always plug in if I
get restless). I can't imagine surviving at Law school without a
lappy, but thats just me.

then again, I don't know what you do with your laptops, Gene :)

Bad assumption.

Not really. If code can sign stuff without me being aware of it that
pretty much invalidates the (already tenuous, since it assumes me trusting
the contents of the frame buffer) concept of a digital signature.

A secure piece of hardware puts the keyring outside of any code's reach.
The key never leaves the hardware compartment. I have to mechanically
acknowledge a signing process. The cryto fob then falls back to the
default state: locked.

A reasonable UI would have me enter my passphrase *at most* each
time I launch my mail program -- never more than once per day,
sometimes once per week.

I'm pretty comfortable with entering my passphrase every time. This is not
production key, as I usually access my home box via a SSH session, and SSH
sessions are easily attackable with a model of your typing pattern. So
don't expect me to announce my plutonium shipments via this medium.

For some of myy workstations, I'd even be happy with the necessary
signing key being cached on disk, so signing is automatic when I
hit 'send'.

If spammer code can read my local hard disk, I have bigger problems
than spoofed spam.

I agree. Nevertheless, a number of people who use cryptography have their
machines compromised.

| 1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list

That (the way I have it configured, and it sounds as if the way Tony does
too) just does a move (rather than select as target without moving).

Of course, if you can manage to get no messages currently selected, then
it works fine.

| 2) In the main window, the "+" key puts you into a "change

This works, but is not nice if you're not using the keyboard, but just
the mouse.

Tony: I agree - a nice way to link in one click would be good, and should
be easy to add, though currently adding mouse bindings (something like
shift right click would be a good choice) is much harder than adding
key bindings.

But note there's no need to "undo" - the way I generally use link, if
the desired destination folder isn't the current selected target, is
to right click on the target, which selects it and moves the message,
(and because I have the "automatic move to the next message on move or
link option set) select the message again, and then "Link".

Exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a
time, that is, one of delete, move, or link. Selecting any of those
implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three (so you cannot
achieve a "move" by doing a link, then delete, then commit, it needs to
be link, commit, delete, commit). (xmh was just the same there incidentally).

| How's spring shaping up "down under"?

No meaningful comment from me, I'm not there at the minute. But I'm told
that where I'm from it is cold, wet, and miserable, though has been better
during the day (sunny days, cold nights) for the past few. In any case,
all of that is a good enough reason to stay away...

Yup, I've been meaning to cobble together procmail + script for this, as
a few Google searches didn't turn up anything. Did anyone here get there
first?

(I guess I want a config file of mailboxes who normally sign their mail,
and procmail that runs gpg and adds headers...)

Users don't like entering passphrases when sending email. USB fobs, smart
cards or other removable hardware are not yet widespread.

Bad assumption.

A reasonable UI would have me enter my passphrase *at most* each
time I launch my mail program -- never more than once per day,
sometimes once per week.

FWIW, the 'Enigmail' add-on for Mozilla's mail client has it happily
talking to GPG (and I believe PGP). You can choose how long it remembers
your passphrase for, default is 15 mins.

see http://enigmail.mozdev.org/

This feature was enough to get my off my Pine habit, since (to answer
the original question) the combination of SpamAssassin and shared
whitelists means that forged 'From:' headers are pretty much the only
spam I see in my inbox now.

2) In the main window, the "+" key puts you into a "change
folder" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
hit a second + and you go to "set a target" mode. Type a few
characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.

I should have finished this off.

3) Keep hitting space to loop thru all the folders that match
the characters you typed. Hit return to actually select the
folder shown in the message area.

I don't use this for navigating into nested folders as the only
thing I have nested is my archives. Someone else will have to
tell you how to do that if there are any tricks to it.

Brent confessed recently that he had tried to subvert the X
model(s) of copy and paste. Not in those words... but that
was how I read it. ;)

I have a lot of trouble copying and pasting from or to exmh
across a VNC link (from things in the vncviewer to things not in
it and vice versa). As long as I stick to apps being "normally"
displayed on my X server I don't have much of a problem.

My recollection from my X programming days is that the X model,
like everything in X, is more complex than the human brain can
handle. It also is very different from the MS-Windows model.
And I get the feeling that Tk tries to "unify" those two models
and fails. Not sure what the exmh-specific contribution to the
confusion is, frankly.

Are you running Gnome 1.4? I had similar problems as did several

others, although I can't say exactly which component did the

something else.

In any case, I have not seen the problem for quite a while, now.

I often use just such a posting to send emails to lists but also to
send them to private individuals who need not be publically exposed on
the list. This is what BCC is for.

Where my spam filter draws the line is for emails which /only/ have
undisclosed recipients, or an obviously bogus recipient.

However, [Link] also uses the same destination folder as [Move], and

[Link]. Very inconvenient.

Is there a better way for me to set this up so that [Link] works
with one or two simple clicks?

According to some old documentation (man exmh-ref)

The mouse bindings for the folders labels are:

Left - Change to folder.
Middle - View nested folders.
Right - Refile current messages to the folder.
Shift-Right - Link current messages to the folder.
Shift-Middle - Drag a folder label to some drop target.
Control-Right - Clear the current target folder.

It should be possible to link using shift-right-click the same way you
can move using only right-click.

Adios to options excess?
If the nation's politicians expect Silicon Valley to fall in line on the issue of expensing stock options, they're living in a fantasy world.

Flipping through my Rolodex this past week, I couldn't find one solitary technology type willing to support even the mildest proposal to change how corporations account for stock options. The more common response was a verbal "middle finger" shouted in the general direction of Washington.

No surprises, there. The options argument is not just about putting food on the table--make that a lot of food, in some cases--but about the way the computer industry views itself. Tech companies believe they belong in a different category, say, from the likes of Coca Cola, Washington Post Co. and Bank One Corp.--all which recently decided to begin expensing stock options.

Tech titans also served notice they will remember to support friends--and shun foes--in Washington next November. An empty threat? Perhaps, but consider this: in the last national election, the computer industry contributed more than $40 million (52 percent to Democrats, 46 percent to Republicans.) That was good for a seventh place ranking, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Charlie Cooper, Executive Editor/Commentary

Why the options party is over

Transamerica Investment Management portfolio manager Kenneth Broad says
it's easy to see why the tech industry is fighting so hard to keep options from
being expensed: no one likes to lose a free lunch.

The case against theft also acknowledges that the value to the thief is
often far less than the value to the victim. Stealing my $1,000 sterio
and then fencing it for $50 does not result in 'no loss' the the economy
overall. For the same reason that voluntary transactions increase
social value, involuntary ones decrease it. If the sterio was worth as
much to the theif as it was to me he'd buy it ...

On the flip side of this, common law allows a breach of property law in
precisely the type of scenarios where a net social gain is recorded but
the owner's availability to make a contract was problematic. Breaking
into your isolated cabin because I'm starving, for example, is
permissible if I later offer restitution for the damage I caused and the
food I ate.

I've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project.
Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers volunteering a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations.

Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to
spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a
good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for organizations that might be in need of such skills. And, I've
seen some very interesting suggestions for names for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the
above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the
subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort
through my email system.

It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users.
According to this article on The Register, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its
previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2
upgrade at $129.

I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how
difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues,
by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early
2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which

were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few

years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain

free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income sources.

On a brighter note, it looks like Mandrake has found a sweet spot. According to their most
recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the
company's
history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put
them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will
only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was
the result of the Mandrake Linux User's
Club.

The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
partnership venture, an agreement with Microtel to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on WalMart.com.
I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine
charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the
addition of both Lindows
and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail
computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.

Have a great Wednesday.

Checking Mail With KMail

I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me from

my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail,
procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong
contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE
desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.

There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't
automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much
time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the
additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an
irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple
configuration issue.

To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in

your KDE panel. Select "Preferences" and the "Execute" tab. In the Execute
window, change the command line to read:

kmail --check -caption "%c" %i %m

The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when
you open the program.

Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?

Kernel Configuration - Part XIII

As you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for
networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to
stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should

come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel
configuration is dense with details and options.

I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of
the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock
configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas.
You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be
used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external).

Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.

For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:

The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo
covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel
configuration issues

Linux Network Security from Linux Planet
a nice tutorial on network security
Network Security with /proc/sys/net/ipv4
other approaches to network security

These should get you started. Tomorrow, we'll cover telephony support in your
Linux kernel.

descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real
downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very

If I have any RPMS in

http://www.dudex.net/rpms/

that could be useful to some one with a real apt repository or someone who wants to
maintain a package, be it known I am not selfish :)

I found stuff I thought would later get popular so I would not have to maintain the
RPMs for them after they hit the big time. Gnump3d is an exapmple of this.

So if anyone is psyched, go for it. If so, let me know so I can get the RPMs from

I do this all the time, It's alot easier then you think if the original
programmer had a clue at all... Java does remove the clue requirement tho,
just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren't as cheap ;)

5. Makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a
person... Java, IMHO, reduces the dependence of these entities on the
individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer Java as it is
to reverse engineer C (large applications).

No it's not, but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high
school. Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it's
working!

Dear Reader,
Basic electronic organizers they're not, but if you're searching
for a pocket-sized computer for music, movies, and games, then
these PDAs are well worth a look. All four models feature fast
processors, large amounts of RAM, and sharp, color screens, which
make them better choices for rich media than competing products.
But beyond those basics, these handhelds are very different. You'll
find three different operating systems: Pocket PC, Palm, and Linux.
Two have keyboards, one has a built-in Bluetooth radio, and all
four support various expansion card formats. Most Pocket PCs are
multimedia friendly; we've picked two that really stand out because
of features or price. However, none of these are inexpensive models,
so check out our hands-on reviews to find the high-end handheld
that you'll be happiest with.

Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or

There is a lot of C++ in the embedded world. With static object

differences disappear, but C++ gives a boost in development and
maintainability.

Agreed, not much difference there. With C it just doesnt seem as wrong to
be crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit
_that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter
as much in the embedded world.

And in the realtime space, or when you have data coming in at 2Gbit/sec
[fibrechannel], every cycle DOES count.

The real issue is compiler availability. Almost every embedded platform
has C cross-compilers. Many have C++ compilers. But there is still a
range of platforms that have the first but not the second. Or at least,
that was the story a few years ago.

Definately still very very true. C++ compilers are still a rarity.

Active Directory unbundled
Microsoft will begin selling its directory technology as a standalone product separate from Windows. The move could be seen as Microsoft's attempt to satisfy those that have accused the software giant of monopolistic practices for integrating a multitude of software into its operating system. Sun and Novell already offer so-called lightweight directory software, so Microsoft is joining an already thriving marketplace for products that store and manage information about users, computer systems and networking devices.

How a CTO faced his worst nightmare

After Sept. 11, investors worried whether the stock market would quickly get back to business. NYSE technology chief Roger Burkhardt was on the job faster than a trader can say "buy." But now Burkhardt and his technology team face a new era of instability marked by fears of terrorist attacks, corporate accounting scandals, and a stock market meltdown. CNET News.com recently spoke with Burkhardt about the technology challenges the NYSE regularly faces because of the whipsaw movements of the stock market.

In what business do we trust?

In response to my recent column, "Desperately seeking chief ethics officer," David Boulton writes: "We are missing the point when we focus on the executives of corporations and miss the underlying ethic of business in general."

Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.

Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
service pack. Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
run C programs.

2. C and C++ forces the developer to solve problems such as memory
management over and over again.

Can't say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management
issues, apart from the fact that I frequently need > 4 GB.

It's about design patterns, architecture, high level stuff...

If your problem just requires application of a "design pattern" to solve,
then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.

I am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low
level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over
and over again...

You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time
on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't. Depends
entirely on the programmer, not the language.

3. Java is not just a programming language! It's also a platform...

Buzzword.

a monolithic set of API's or a crap load of different API's slicing
and dicing the same problems 50 different ways?

Unsupported assertion.

4. If you have a program of any type of high complexity written in C, you
can't possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within
the same magnitude of cost as Java....

Dunno. E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC
in a few minutes yesterday. Sure if it was badly designed it would be
10 times the size and harder to port. If it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder. Portable code is easy to port.
At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.

5. Makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a
person... Java, IMHO, reduces the dependence of these entities on the
individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer Java as it is
to reverse engineer C (large applications).

You can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get
some kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for
maintenance headaches ad infinitum.

6. Hardware is getting so fast that I'm not sure if the performance
difference between Java and C/C++ are relevant any more.

Whoah!!! Performance matters to me every day. (Right now I'm taking
time out to write email while waiting for a job to run). Sure I could
wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code
that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,
or I can do it now when very few people can.

The end goal is the scientific or business problem to be solved.

Yes.

And for those problems, languages such as Java, SmallTalk, and others
allow you to think more high level than low level. Thinking of bits
and bytes takes too much gray matter away from the real important
problems....

It's true! I admit everything! Mea maxima culpa! Working in C makes
me spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!
Not.

Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.

Why do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problems
over and over again [...]

Dunno, and frankly I don't see the relevance to the issue at hand.

I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever. Horses for
courses.

Bye,
Rob.

I had just finished giving Ben and his sister a "behind
the scenes" look at our set, when Patrick walked in and poked me
in the left arm repeatedly with his index finger - until I hung up
the phone and gave him my full, undivided attention. "Did you know
that your GnomeTomes are being featured in the 'Barnes & Noble'
eBooks section," he asked. Well, that was news to me. After
flailing over to his workstation and flipping through a few pages,
we ultimately realized that he had discovered the entry on the
main page for Amazon's
eBooks. Cool! "With a name that inspires curiosity and sparks the imagination,
Lockergnome represents one of the latest and most popular
additions to our e-documents catalog. At prices starting under $3,
these eminently useful titles from one of the most fanciful-sounding
publishers we've encountered are hard to resist." Thank
you for helping us along, gang. My ultimate goal is to kick that
Godin guy out of the top ten - if only for a day.

I must now thank both Lockergnomie Dan Reain and Nancy Workman-Luter
(both from Sonic Foundry) for donating a couple more prizes
for this year's Gnomedex
conference. Just by walking through the entrance with your
pass in hand, you'll be automatically entered to win one of the
copies of Sound Forge XP! And this software is no slouch; for home
users and professionals on a Windows OS, it's one of the best
audio editors around. If it can't do something you need to have
done, then I bet it can't be done at all. Expect a full
Lockergnome review from our Digital Media editor (Jake) at some
point in the future. Until then, feel free to
download
the demo. If I can ever decide on a digital video camera,
perhaps their Vegas Video will sit on my system, too. Melanie and
I were talking about hardware options the other day. She's leaning
towards a Canon, too. Unless I hear or see otherwise, the ZR45MC
is at the top of my list. Still and low-light images aren't the
best, but I'm not really up for spending much more than $1000.
Neither is Gretchen, oddly enough.

As much as I dislike the AOL client user interface, I gotta admit:
it's pretty darn powerful underneath. For instance, you can
"unsend" an e-mail message (but only if it was sent to another
America Online member and s/he hasn't read it yet). If you travel
often, the service is a bargain. If you know someone who just
needs the Internet basics, it's perfect. One caveat: the software
puts RealPlayer on your system without asking you first. I was a
little upset when I discovered its icon sitting in my Start Menu.
Nowhere during the installation process did I see a way to opt out
of it. I'm not surprised; there are more advertisements on AOL
than there are from your average "free" Web page host. You may
have asked yourself: "What is Chris doing installing AOL in the
first place?!" I don't blame
you. No, hell did not freeze over. We've been doing tips for
their users on our show lately, and I decided to throw it on my
laptop for testing purposes. Perhaps 8.0 will be better?

SEPopular v1.02 [2.4M] W9x/2k/XP FREE

http://www.monocle-solutions.com/sepopular/sepopular.shtml

{Popularity contest} I never considered myself to be part of the popular crowd. But how do you really know if others consider you to be popular? Well, if you are talking about the popularity of your website (although the junior high kids are more concerned about the labels on your clothes), then all you have to do is download SEPopular. Search engines (such as Google) rank your site by determining how many people link to your site (the more people who link to your site, the better your ranking). With this investigative tool, you can see how many links to your website there are (from the perspective of five major search engines). You don't just have to check out your own website, though... all you have to do is enter the URL of a website, and out comes the TRUTH about its popularity. Another nice feature of this software is that you can import web addresses from a .txt file so that you don't have to enter each one individually. It's all about keeping up with thejoneses.com.

MB-Ruler v0.93 [441k] W9x/2k/XP FREE

{Measure distance and angles} I was never very good in geometry... Pythagoras would be disappointed that I can never exactly remember his theorem. (What did a hippopotamus have to do with triangles anyway? That animal seems to be pretty round if you ask me...) Anyway, MB-Ruler is quite a useful little application, especially for anyone who has had to work with banners and graphics for the Web. You can measure angles in radians or degrees, and distances in inches, centimeters, twips, points or pixels. And if those weren't enough options, you can even set your own scale. Everything about MB-Ruler can be customized, including its size and color. Talk about an application that "measures up!"

{Fixing password problems} Now where did I put that password? I thought I had Outlook Express keeping track of it for me... If you use Outlook Express (for Windows 2000 or Windows XP) to check your e-mail, then this article is for you. Occasionally your password for Outlook Express is not retained, even though you have checked the "Remember Password" checkbox. To fix this particular issue, you will need Administrator privileges in order to make some modifications to your system's registry.

Re-route E-mail Forwarding Service

http://www.re-route.com/

Soon, it will be time for us to fill out the change of address cards as we relocate to a different area of the city. You probably knew that your snail mail could be forwarded, but what about your e-mail? Back in the days of college e-mail accounts, every time I changed ISPs I had to send a mass e-mail to my contacts and hope they saved my new address, otherwise I could miss out on getting their correspondence. The great thing about Re-Route's service is that I don't have to worry about lost e-mails after changing ISPs. Sign up for the service, and they will take any e-mail sent to your old account and forward it to your new e-mail address. After that, Re-Route e-mails the sender to notify them of your new address. If you are with AOL, MSN, or any of their featured partners, then the first month is free. If not, then Re-Route charges a very nominal fee of ten bucks for the one month and twenty-five bucks for 3 months. Have someone else handle all my changing e-mail address need!

GnomeTIP

Just because it is summer and bright out doesn't mean that you should stop using your flash on your digital camera. Bright sunlight creates harsh shadows that may cause you to lose detail. Don't you hate those pictures where you can only see half of someone's face because the other half is black from a shadow? Well, the cure is in front of you... use your flash during the daytime to throw a little light into those shadows. Some cameras allow you to adjust how much flash is used, also known as flash exposure compensation. If you can adjust the output of your flash, then try it at the lowest setting first. Remember, you don't want to completely get rid of the shadows because they add depth to your photo. Keep increasing your flash output until you get your desired results. Also, as an extra tip, don't forget that you can conserve battery life on your digital camera by turning on the autofocus option and turning off the LCD display.

CNET | NEWS.COM WEEK IN REVIEW
The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email
Saturday, July 20, 2002

Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Compute=
r trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it migh=
t be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by unveiling new=
iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.

The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that u=
se Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the exi=
sting 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with=
a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod fo=
r $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three m=
odels for Windows users with MusicMatch software.

As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel mon=
itor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolut=
ion versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.

Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will =
be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with =
improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change t=
he background photo as often as every 5 seconds.

But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a ch=
eap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a disc=
ounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to curr=
ent users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will h=
ave to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating syst=
em for the retail price of $129.

Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qu=
alitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions s=
hare the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and ser=
vices, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvou=
s, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.

Apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its iTools Web serv=
ices from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans t=
o charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web service=
s was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a=
service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other featu=
res.

Despite iTool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell w=
ith the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture=
. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously =
free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when=
free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to=
form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently=
.

To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of=
services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organiz=
ed than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However,=
an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode wel=
l for the program.

Microsoft's moves
Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to offer a=
rebate for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software=
bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in re=
bate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for=
those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.

The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have no=
t met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000=
copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the =
program went on sale last November.

Microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third co=
llection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after=
a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, c=
ontains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the o=
perating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 co=
uld be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security f=
ixes are available as separate downloads.

Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Micro=
soft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has shut down a =
site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. T=
he company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java =
inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the=
forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.

Somebody's watching you

You better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yah=
oo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter=
to swap out a handful of words such as "mocha" and "eval" that=
pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.

The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as "Web enhanced" can contai=
n JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaS=
cript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser=
to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for =
example.

"Mocha" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced =
e-mail. Typing "mocha:" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will =
open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which comma=
nds can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command =
line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person'=
s knowledge.

On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. g=
overnment is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious acti=
vity in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled mor=
e details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan=
to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or =
suspicious behavior.

"The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the dail=
y course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual=
or suspicious activity in public places," according to the TIPS Web site. =
But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan,=
fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possib=
ly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.

Also of note
A handful of entrepreneurial technology companies are advancing tec=
hniques once used haphazardly by record companies and Napster-haters, i=
n ways that may be far more destructive to the credibility of file-swapping=
networks than were previous efforts...Apple released the final=
version of its QuickTime 6 digital media software, marking a stand-down in=
a dispute over licensing fees...The Federal Trade Commission is pl=
anning to take a deeper look at whether some state laws illegally restr=
ict Internet commerce...In one of the toughest sentences for online auction=
fraud, a Virginia man was sentenced to 12 years in prison fo=
r defrauding hundreds of shoppers on eBay and Yahoo auction sites...The Hou=
se of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bill that would allow for life prison sentences for malicious computer hackers...MPEG LA, =
a group of patent holders governing MPEG-4, finalized licensing ter=
ms for the media delivery standard, bowing to market pressure for manag=
eable royalty rates...Several tech and telecommunications giants are considering a joint venture to pepper the United States with wireless=
"hot spots."

I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the the
choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE.
It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which
is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is
somewhat simpler to setup.

The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites
run OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of
IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.

So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a
significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?
If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever
on the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote
sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity
in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.

I am trying to manage the email for a domain which I have hosted with
hosting365, and am trying to get the whole email send and receive thing
working nice and easily.
At the moment I have configured Fetchmail to poll the different pop3
mailboxes and deliver the mail accordingly, although it appears that I have
to have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop3 mailbox.
This could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, but
It would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mail
from the different mailboxes, and then deliver it locally according to the
"To:" header instead of the pop3 mailbox it came from.
The other issue I am having is sending outgoing mail. I have been trying to
use sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and
when the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have
checked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how
to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail. Do any of
the outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'
configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration
files like sendmail.

Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated. There
are only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for
scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me
fine.

Thanks,

David.

Hi All,
I'm trying to set up the following:

1. A Linux server running with a modem for internet connectivity and an
ethernet card for LAN connectivity
2. Other LAN pcs with ethernet cards, using the Linux server for
DNS/DHCP etc.

Basically, I want to route any non LAN traffic through the ppp0.

I've got some of the way, but like a similar post earlier about modem
problems, when I am connected to the internet with eht0 up, the routing
is all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp0 (eh0 must be the
default route or something).

Is there standard "out of the box" Linux tools that will carry out
portmapping on behalf of the LAN PCs ? (I'm planning on non routable
addresses 192.168.x.x for the LAN, routed outwards via the ppp0
interface).

Can someone point me at the right HOWTOs or routing documentation I need
to follow ?
Thanks,
Dermot.

This year's SIC gets the blame for the
lateness of this issue. Lori and I spent Wednesday thru Sunday meeting
software authors, participating in educational sessions, viewing product
demonstrations, and most of all having fun. This was Lori's second trip
to an SIC conference, so she got to reacquaint herself with many familiar
faces, while I was getting to put faces with many people I've exchanged
e-mails with over the last several years. As much as I enjoy information
exchange via computer, the human interaction of meeting people and
sharing ideas and stories face-to-face is priceless.

One cool discovery at this year's SIC, pertaining directly to Webmasters,
is Nick Bradbury's release of
TopStyle 3.0.
Nick's the guy who created HomeSite, long before it joined the Macromedia
family of products. Version 3 represents a return to those HTML editing
roots, with the addition of editing capabilities now functioning
hand-in-hand with the rock solid style sheet building features that
previously defined TopStyle. Conversion of existing font tags to CSS is
just one of several new additions. I should have a full review in one of
the next two issues.

Hi,

Can anyone point me to a howto on running mailing lists. Not looking for
anything that is package specific, but rather something that
gives general
info on the various Email headers and dealing with returned
mails, errors in

Thanks

Hackers and crackers respect only one thing: strong security. Keep the bad guys out of your PC or network with the advanced technology that's trusted by millions: ZoneAlarm Pro 3.0. This best-in-class personal firewall stops hackers cold, defends your online privacy,and sets up in minutes. Click here to download now!

Listen to Lockergnomie Dale Lowery and you'll save time
immediately. It's an old tip, but it bears repeating: "I'll often
find Web snippets I'd like to keep - but I don't want to save the
entire page. So, I've HOT-KEYED Notepad. Easy! Get to the most
common Notepad shortcut icon: Start | Programs | Accessories |
Notepad. Then right-click on the menu item and select Properties.
You'll see that this is (indeed) a shortcut; in the lower part of
the dialog is a field to add a hotkey. I entered 'N' for Notepad,
Windows offered CTRL and ALT as a prefix, and now I can launch
Notepad in an instant. I highlight the text I want to keep, copy
it, tap my shortcut, paste it, and then save the new text file
wherever I want. Most often, I use this trick to copy paragraphs
that describe downloads (and save them as text files in the same
folder as the download)." Just make sure you don't pick a keyboard
shortcut that's already in use. Otherwise, one of them is gonna
get cranky.

And while we're taking a trip down memory lane, Lockergnomie Ian
Rich reminds us of Jouni Vuorio's utility: The site is
jv16.org. The program is called
jv16 Power Tools, and this freeware is truly worthy of praise. It
combines a full-on registry management tool with several file
manager tools: one to hunt down temporary files in any format and
the other to help perform advanced file searches and comparisons.
Mainly, I wanted the program to be brought to the attention of the
consumer public, as it moves further and further along in
development it just keeps getting better. I've used it on windows
Me, and now XP - without crashes or hair-raising Registry
corruption. It backs up everything it changes and is very easy to
use. If you're interested in something of shareware-quality with
forum support (for absolutely nothing), get this program. Anyway,
I love the newsletter and the work you guys and gals do at
Lockergnome. I hope that this author gets his recognition."
Consider this a huge nod!

I love a good resource, and Lockergnomie Elton Jonsson from the
United Kingdom has one for us, too: "As a dedicated subscriber, I
just had to tell about this one. Have you ever been driven mad
trying to find out the name of the piece of music on a television
advert? Well, at last, here in the UK, we have an answer to that
problem and, given that many multinationals use the same
advertising in the USA as they do here, it may help out you guys
as well. Check out Commercial
Breaks and Beats. I have no connection with it; I'm just
grateful that someone has had the brilliant idea of creating it.
If you check the message board on the site, you'll see that I'm
not alone." This Google
Directory can help fill in the blanks, I'm sure. I
almost fell out of my chair the other day when I heard "Yeh Yeh"
(by TMBG) being played on a Chrysler advertisement. Way to go:
John, John, Dan, Dan, and Dan! You're the dogs kids love to bite.

And what's say we round out the report with another tip?
Lockergnomie David Brown can oblige: "The e-mail forwarding
service is a good idea, but you can do it yourself with Outlook
Express. Set up two accounts (one for your old account and one for
your new one). Craft your reply in a new message and save it.
Then, select Tools | Message Rules | Mail | New rule. Check 'Where
the message is from specified account' in the first section.
'Reply with message" in section two. Select the appropriate
account and message in the final section. Name it. You can also
have the messages flagged or moved to another folder if you want
to know which messages came from the old account. Once the rule
has been created, any mail from the old account will have a reply
sent. People should learn about mail rules, anyway." True! So,
what rule simplifies your day?

See You in August, Chris Pirillo

QuicKalendar v1.0.2 [430k] W9x/2k/XP FREE

http://www.trinfinitysoftware.com/quickalendar.shtml

{Calendar utility} You say you want to get together on the 25th, but what DAY is that? I'm not good with calendar dates; truth be told, I don't even know what day of the week it is most the time. If I didn't have my PDA armed with a Calendar with me, then I wouldn't show up to anything on time, let alone on the right day. Well, that is great for when I am mobile, but what about when I am in front of my PC? The PDA is docked, but that doesn't mean I have to be without a calendar... enter QuicKalendar! "QuicKalendar gives you quick and easy access to a calendar whenever you need it. You can view the calendar on screen, or print it out to jot down notes and appointments." You need to keep in mind that the print feature is relative to how you have QuicKalendar displayed on your machine. If you are in full screen mode, then the printout will be bigger than a standard sheet of letter paper. If you try printing in normal view, then the printout will be too small to write on. My suggestion is to play with the size of QuicKalendar's screen until you get a printout that you can be proud of. Now, you'll have no reason to be late for Gnomedex!

Diatris v1.0 [407k] W9x/2k/XP FREE

http://www.webruler.com/mtreciokas/

{Tetris-like game} I've always been fascinated with geometric shapes. To me everything has to be somewhat symmetrical... even my hair! So it was no wonder why I was addicted to playing the game Tetris for so many years. The only problem with Tetris is that, after awhile, it starts to get a little too easy. Diatris is a bundle of three different - and much more challenging - Tetris-like games. "For the first game, Y-Diatris, the objects can move vertically and diagonally. The second game, X-Diatris, the objects can move only in two diagonal directions; the vertical drop is taken out. For the last game H-Diatris the objects can only move vertically and horizontally like most block drop games." I won't kid you, these games can be pretty hard, but if you are a Tetris fan, then these set of games are for you. If you're not a Tetris fan, don't worry, there are a few other games you might like on this site, so check it out!

How to Troubleshoot Issues with Reading CDs

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q321641

{Disc device troubleshooting} "This article describes how you can troubleshoot issues reading CD-ROM or DVD-ROM optical discs. This article also discusses how to troubleshoot common issues with CD-R and CD-RW devices. The steps in this article apply to compact disc (CD-ROM) drives, compact disc recordable (CD-R) drives, compact disc re-writable (CD-RW) drives, and digital video disc (DVD) drives." To summarize, you should try the steps on this site before calling your technical support. Some of the steps include closing unnecessary software, testing the disc in a different computer, and cleaning the disc. Make sure to clean a disc by wiping from the center of the disc outward... if you wipe the disc in a circular fashion, then you risk scratching it. The steps in this article will only serve to save you time, as you will probably be able to fix most disc problems by following the steps. If this article doesn't help you resolve your disc problem, look on the bright side... you won't have to spend so much time on the phone with technical support, because you'll already know what the problem ISN'T!

Modem Spy v3.1.3b [230k] W9x/2k/XP $25
Unearthed by Sergei Polishchuk

http://www.modemspy.com/

{Answering machine} "Modem spy is a handy utility for phone calls recording. Features: 1) Records phone conversations. 2) Records from microphone. 3) Plays back recorded messages via phone line. 4) Plays back recorded messages via sound card. 5) Can record ALL incoming phone calls. 6) Has built-in software automatic gain control. 7) Detects and logs Caller ID." Gnomie Brian Stevens tried this one out for us, but had a small problem testing this on any of his machines... he doesn't have any modems! Brian says, "I was able to load the program, though, and try a few of the features out. You can record an audio memo to your machine, much like an answering machine. You can also e-mail this audio memo, although I don't recommend you do that as the WAV file didn't seem to play well when I tried e-mailing it to myself (which may have been due to the microphone it was recorded with). Other than that, Modem Spy is a solid program and is a great alternative to buying a traditional answering machine... plus in most cases it is cheaper!" Keep in mind that, for Caller ID to work, you need the Caller ID service turned on by your phone service provider.

The Avocado Papers
Unearthed by Meryl Evans

http://www.theavocadopapers.com/

After surfing serious Web site upon serious Web site, you just need to find a site where you can relax and have a good time. TheAvocadoPapers.com is one of those sites that is a little bit goofy but extremely creative. It isn't that the Web site is really about anything; there is some creative writing (usually rather funny) and the occasional interview (this week "Steve Schneider Interviews Himself"). If you are a little bit nosy, and want to peek into the lives of others, you can read Ron Bork's diary or enter the Avocado Chat. Although the makers of the Web site don't even know what it is about, I think it is quite apparent... fun! Go check out the Web site for yourself and see if you can pin down its rhyme or reason. Worst-case scenario, you can always sign up for their current promotion... free linguine!

GnomeTIP

This tip is for the Windows XP users out there. "The Windows XP operating system achieves excellent performance in part by dynamic adjustments that it makes in response to how a system is utilized. In particular, many adjustments are made when the system first runs following setup and when newly installed applications are used for the first time. These adjustments greatly influence the performance of the system. Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of Windows XP can make benchmarking more of a challenge than with previous Windows versions." To properly benchmark your Windows XP system, there are a few steps you should follow. The step with which we are concerned in this particular tip is letting your PC process any "idle tasks." Idle tasks are tasks that your PC executes when it deems the system to be unused or idle. Some of these include file placement optimization, system restore, and done-once-after-setup work items. "All of these 'idle tasks' are controllable by a system API in advapi32.dll, ProcessIdleTasks. The API's sole purpose is to allow benchmarks a simple way to force any pending idle tasks to be executed immediately, without having to wait a lengthy period of time. To call ProcessIdleTasks from the command line, use this syntax: Rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks." Once running, it may take up to around 15 minutes to process all of the idle tasks, and your hard drive will be active through most of it. For more steps on preparing your Windows XP machine for benchmarking, head over to the Windows Platform Development page on Benchmarking for Windows XP on Microsoft's site.

Your actual serial number is 1519761310 - from a dig I've just done.

Try resetting the zone number to 2002082901 - some of your secondaries seem
to have a serial number below that, so they clearly regard 1519761310 as
being less than 2002082601.

That should enable them to pick up the new zonefile.

Its okay to set this back to todays date but I understand that our

Is there any way I can reset this on the secondary and terninary DNS

Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with
spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in
other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.

My concern doesn't stem from failing to understand how your business is
intended to work. My concern is the lack of empirical evidence that it
will reduce the amount of uncaught spam.

Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after
regular spammers. Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant
pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but
the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.
So, I can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track
spammers down when it's never really been tried.

Please don't misquote me. I did not assert that you "can't track
spammers". Here is what I said:

| It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in
| various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good
| example) even if they do officially "respect" copyright law.

I understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers, but that
does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox. It is
an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient
to counteract the ease with which a -20 score on the mark allows spam to
avoid being tagged as spam.

Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself
on your installation. If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to
only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all
violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will
quickly remove us from the next release. But, you're trying to kill
Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise.

I think I've worked on SA enough to understand that I can localize a
score. I'm just not comfortable with using SpamAssassin as a vehicle
for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base.

I think it would make more sense to start Habeas with a less aggressive
score (one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyone's
inbox) and after we've seen evidence that the system works, then we can
increase the magnitude of the score.

Subject: Aussie paper: US planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen
spies

Anybody ever heard of Pavlik Morozov? (If not see
http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/morozov.html for a quick blurb about the
fellow.) When I see proposals to mobilize American people into being eyes
and ears fo the government, I am reminded of Pavilik and his family.

Now I am not against people reporting certain things to the police. It is
the habit of being constantly suspicious of neighbors, co-workers, and
otehrs that can become destructive. Down the line it can lead to suspicions
based not on significant clues but upon things such as "fails to display
sufficient respect for authority", "laughs whenever the phrase 'homeland
security' is used", and "hangs out with anti-social misfits." It is an all
too easy slide from neighbors watching out for each and helping the
community to becoming agents of the state.

US planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen spies
By Ritt Goldstein
July 15 2002

The Bush Administration aims to recruit millions of United States citizens
as domestic informants in a program likely to alarm civil liberties groups.

The Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS, means the US will
have a higher percentage of citizen informants than the former East Germany
through the infamous Stasi secret police. The program would use a minimum
of 4 per cent of Americans to report "suspicious activity".

Civil liberties groups have already warned that, with the passage earlier
this year of the Patriot Act, there is potential for abusive, large-scale
investigations of US citizens.

As with the Patriot Act, TIPS is being pursued as part of the so-called war
against terrorism. It is a Department of Justice project.

Highlighting the scope of the surveillance network, TIPS volunteers are
being recruited primarily from among those whose work provides access to
homes, businesses or transport systems. Letter carriers, utility employees,
truck drivers and train conductors are among those named as targeted recruits.

A pilot program, described on the government Web site www.citizencorps.gov,
is scheduled to start next month in 10 cities, with 1 million informants
participating in the first stage. Assuming the program is initiated in the
10 largest US cities, that will be 1 million informants for a total
population of almost 24 million, or one in 24 people.

I don't think there's much more room for lowering FPs left which the GA can
achieve. Remember, also, that the AWL will reduce FPs, but its effects aren't
factored in to the GA scores.

The work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of
doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we
really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as
time goes on.

The FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be
better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the
2.41 or 2.50 branches.

DQ> Something like:
DQ>
DQ> for (low = -12; low for (high = 2; high evolve

You could just allow low and high to be evolved by the GA (within ranges); I'd
be enormously surprised if it didn't end up with low=-12 and high=+6, since
that'd give the GA the broadest lattitude in setting individual scores. The
issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of
human-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous
and liable to generate FPs, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and
liable to be forged to generate FNs.

DQ> Maybe even add a nybias loop.

Adding an nybias loop is not worthwhile -- changing nybias scores will just
alter the evaluation function's idea of what the FP:FN ratio should be.

I've been searching for that, but I guess the details of where the channel was

NFS as a protocol is not known for its speediness but this is absurd. I did an
NFS install of a box this morning (that would be the box which won't boot
from CD for those who were in IRC) and it was rather slow but I just left it
to it. Having got it up, I want to copy the DVD to a disk on it so I have it
handy for installing any further bits I might require. So I simply mounted
the NFS exported DVD on the new box and started copying.

After a couple of minutes I looked - it was transferring about 8MB a MINUTE.
So I killed that and used rsync instead which is ticking away now at about
100 MB/min - still not exactly turbo charged but a lot better than the NFS
rate. Any ideas as to what's making it SO slow ? There's really no point in
running more nfsd processes, as there is exactly one client, so I'm a little
at a loss I must say.

Thanks for posting this tip - I had the same problem compiling with

When I did the "make install" I got this error:

It appears that this comes from the "inst_cfs:" part of the Makefile,
which copies local.cf into /etc/mail/spamassassin. The Makefile has
brackets around the -f test, but they don't show up above. Any ideas?

I don't think I could argue that ZODB is more reliable that
BerkeleyDB. It's true that we have fewer database experts and expend
fewer resources working on database reliability. On the other hand,
Barry is nearly finished with a BerkeleyDB-based storage for ZODB.

ZODB is an object persistence tool that uses a database behind it.
You can use our FileStorage or you can use someone else's database,
although BerkeleyDB is the best we can offer at the moment. (It would
be really cool to do a Postgres storage...)

This sounds like a Zope complaint that doesn't have anything to do
with ZODB, but maybe I misunderstand you. You don't have to store
your code in the database, although that will be mostly possible in
ZODB4.

Seriously, ZODB stores object pickles in a database. The storage
layer is free to manage those pickles however it likes. FileStorage
uses a single file. Toby Dickenson's DirectoryStorage represents each
pickle as a separate file.

It grows without bound unless you pack it. Why is that a problem?
BerkeleyDB log files grow without bound, too. Databases require some
tending. One possibility with FileStorage is to add an explicit
pack() call to update training operation. We'd need to think
carefully about the performance impact.

I think we'd want a spambayes installer that packaged up spambayes,

So then, "Mark Hammond" is all like:

So, given that, ZODB is sounding attractive. I would package it up, so a
few hundred extra K is probably no big deal. The code could fall back to
the slow-loading pickles, so people running from source still work, just
possibly not as well.

I haven't used ZODB much really but it sure looks like the Right Way. I
don't think it will fly with the unwashed Unix masses, but it sounds
like a piece of cake with the Windows crowd. That makes sense; you only
have one OS vendor and one processor family to support.

I'm going to go sulk in /dev/corner now.

Not a deb-head, but I also have a problem regards NVidia. I've two machines,
pretty much the same hardware.
athlon 1700XP's, both have NVidia cards, one Gforce3 Ti and a Gforce2MX,
both use the same driver module.

Both have same kernel version albeit it compiled for their particular
hardware.

One works perfectly, the other fails to load. When I check with lsmod, I can
see the NVdriver is loaded, but not used ;--(
Thus when I startx, it bombs out.

IU still have X with the default nv driver and crappy accelleration -->
650fps with glxgears [should be over 2000fps]
Its not a hardware issue with the cards as I swapped them over and get the
same symptoms.

I reckon my mobo is cack, I've tried swapping slots around, reserving
resources etc all to no avail.
Should there be an interrupt for the nv card? I haven't checked the other
box yet.

Regards,
CW

You probably stil are ;)

Both the kernel and GLX packages installed with no problem and I then
amended the XFree config file appropriately (according to all
instructions). Neither GDM nor KDM will now fire up returning me to the
console screen.

ie X is broken.

Running startx I isolated the problem to a failure to load the nvidia
kernel module - By cd'ing to the kernel module file and re-running 'make
install' I can get a workable xserver

so you fixed X.

minus the preferences you would get from either gdm or kdm and to be
honest the GUI is horrible.

If X is working and you get a brief Nvidia splash screen then this is
likely nothing to do with the driver itself. You should be able to use kdm
or gdm with the nvidia Xserver. What exactly did you change in your
XF86Config? Will gdm/kdm not start?

I followed the nvidia suggestion of 'make install
SYSINCLUDE=/path/to/kernel/headers' and whilst this appears to install
ok upon reboot I am back to the same console login and having to go
through the same reinstall of the kernel module. I have tried rewriting
the XF config file to it's original state with no success.

Well, this sounds like the NVIDIA kernel module isn't loading on boot.
When it *is* working do a quick

/sbin/lsmod

and look for the module name (something like 'NVDriver'). Then put this on
a new line in

/etc/modules

in order that linux will load it on boot. You can just do

modprobe nvdriver

to load it by hand. Your make install did this as well as reinstalling the
driver in /lib etc. You should also get a message saying loading the
nvidia driver taints your kernel (which it does, in the sense that it's not
open source).

Is this a problem anyone else has encountered and what is the best
solution? Can I rid myself of the tar file installations and find some
specific .deb packages?

The nvidia driver source is in the Woody tree.

http://packages.debian.org/stable/x11/nvidia-kernel-src.html

so you can do

apt-get install nvidia-kernel-src

and then compile, although I've always gone the route you're doing now.

Ideally the nvidia driver would be a part of the kernel from day 1.
However, nvidia have not open sourced it (most of the above source is
pre-compiled object code), but in order for it to work with your specific
kernel you must compile against your kernel headers (as you did). As
debian has lots of potential kernels they can't have one nvdriver package
and have chosen instead to provide the source. Actually I don't know if
they're permitted to distribute binaries by nvidia's license anyway.

I recently installed Razor v2.14 and started using it. I am finding it
necessary to whitelist a _lot_ of mailing lists. Some, such as yahoogroups,
I can't whitelist because the from: address is the person making the post,
so I will have to whitelist on another field when I can modify my code to do
so. I wonder if someone is not being careful about their submissions, or if
these are bad mailing lists that don't drop bad mail addresses that become
trollboxes in time.

Any employee who has left my company more than three years ago is eligible
to become a trollbox. I figure after three years of bounced mail, the list
should have figured out they aren't here any more.

I don't know if there's a sendmail-ish way (it's not in the -d0.1 output),
but this should work:

$ strings `which sendmail` | grep -i milter

If you get a long list of function/message looking phrases, milter
is built-in. If you get something like:

Do you have a dialup or something more modern ? 134MB of messages
zipped would probably compress pretty well - under 50MB I'd guess with all
the similarity in the headers and such. You could zip each of the 10 sets
individually and upload them somewhere.

How about random sampling lots of public mailing lists via gmane or
something similar, manually cleaning it (distributing that load over a
number of people) and then relying on your clever code and your rebalancing
script to help further cleanse it? The "problem" with the ham is it tends
to be much more tied to one person (not just intimate, but unique) than the
spam.

I save all incoming email for ten days (gzipped mbox format) before it rolls
over and disappears. At any one time I think I have about 8,000-10,000
messages. Most of it isn't terribly personal (which I would cull before
passing along anyway) and much of it is machine-generated, so would be of
marginal use. Finally, it's all ham-n-spam mixed together. Do we call that
an omelette or a Denny's Grand Slam?

Skip
[Tim]
Another area for potentially fruitful study: it's clear that the
highest-value indicators usually appear "early" in msgs, and for spam
there's an actual reason for that: advertising has to strive
to get your attention early. So, for example, if we only bothered to
tokenize the first 90% of a msg, would results get worse?

[Neil Schemenauer]
Spammers could exploit this including a large MIME part at the beginning
of the message. In pratice that would probably work fine.

Note that timtest.py's current tokenizer only looks at decoded text/* MIME
sections (or raw message text if no MIME exists); spammers could put
megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn't even be looked at
(except that the email package has to parse non-text/* parts well enough to
skip over them, and tokens for the most interesting parts of Content-{Type,
Disposition, Transfer-Encoding} decorations are generated for all MIME
sections).

Schemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers putting
arbitrary amounts of "nice text" in the preamble area (after the headers and
before the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, but
which appear first in the file so are latched on to by Graham's scoring
scheme.

But I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that they
exist . Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that no
particular scheme will gain dominance, and there's no percentage for
spammers in trying to fool just one scheme. Even if they did, for the kind
of scheme we're using here they can't *know* what "nice text" is, not unless
they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their
messages to each different one. At that point they'd be doing targeted
marketing, and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously.

I've got a test set here that's the last 3 and a bit years email to
info@ekit.com and info@ekno.com - it's a really ugly set of 20,000+
messages, currently broken into 7,000 spam, 9,000 ham, 9,000 currently
unclassified. These addresses are all over the 70-some different
ekit/ekno/ISIConnect websites, so they get a LOT of spam.

As well as the usual spam, it also has customers complaining about
credit card charges, it has people interested in the service and
asking questions about long distance rates, &c &c &c. Lots and lots
of "commercial" speech, in other words. Stuff that SA gets pretty
badly wrong.

I'm currently mangling it by feeding all parts (text, html, whatever
else :) into the filters, as well as both a selected number of headers
(to, from, content-type, x-mailer), and also a list of
(header,count_of_header). This is showing up some nice stuff - e.g. the
X-uidl that stoopid spammers blindly copy into their messages.

I did have Received in there, but it's out for the moment, as it causes
rates to drop.

I'm also stripping out HTML tags, except for href="" and src="" - there's
so so much goodness in them (note that I'm only keeping the contents of
the attributes).

Are you sure that's in a text/plain MIME section? I've seen that many times

it's something a non-MIME aware reader will show you).

The other thing on my todo list (probably tonight's tram ride home) is

Hi

I've just installed SpamAssassin and relevant modules.
Just tried the initial test:

spamassassin -t nonspam.out

and got back:

Broken Pipe

I've also tried using the -P and --pipe option but to
no avail.

Any help greatly appreciated. BTW - I'm no great Perl
expert!

=================================
What's Hot in the World of DivX(tm) Video This Week:
Battle of the Planets in DivX, Warcraft III, and the Latest Skins
Now Sent to Over 1.6 Million DivX Fans Worldwide!

Welcome to this week's edition of DivX News, your weekly fix of
information about what's hot and what's cool in the world of
DivX video.

(You are being sent this email because you subscribed to this
newsletter at DivX.com. If you'd like to unsubscribe, follow

1. Classic Battle of the Planets in DivX Video
2. Warcraft III with DivX Video Sells like Hotcakes
3. Skins, Skins and More Skins

Battle of the Planets in DivX Video!
------------------------------------

One of the best things about DivX Video is the way it has opened
up distribution possibilities for a lot of cool videos that may
not otherwise be widely seen. From independent short films to cult
movies with strong underground followings, a number of filmmakers
and distributors are discovering that DivX Video provides a great
way to get their content in front of new audiences.

A perfect example of that phenomenon is the groundbreaking
animated series "Battle of the Planets" from Sandy Frank
Entertainment. Originally shown on American television in the late
1970s, Battle of the Planets gained a popular following and was
one of the forerunners of the wildly popular anime style. The
series chronicled the adventures of a group of intergalactic
adventurers as they battled evil and protected the universe from
invaders. Beloved among anime fans, 70s nostalgia buffs, and
anyone who enjoys great sci-fi animation, the series is the
subject of a number of fan sites and discussion groups throughout
the Internet. You can now re-live the adventures of the Battle of
the Planets crew in high-quality DivX video. The classic episode
"Mammoth Shark Menace" is currently featured on the DivX Showcase,
and stay tuned for more news about future Battle of the Planets
episodes to come.

* Watch "Battle of the Planets 55: Mammoth Shark Menace" in the
DivX Showcase:

Warcraft III Sets Sales Records
-------------------------------

A while ago, we told you that the highly anticipated game
"Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos" from Blizzard Entertainment would
feature DivX Video for cinematic cut scenes. In early July,
Blizzard released "Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos" with
record-setting results, shipping over 4.5 million copies to
retailers. Coincidence? You be the judge. You can look forward to
more announcements about DivX technology in some of your favorite
games in the near future....

* Watch the "Warcraft III" Trailer in High-quality DivX Video:

The Latest DivX Player Skins
----------------------------

Let's face it--if you don't have the latest Player skins, you're
just not cool.

* DisPlayer: A sleek, stylish full-screen skin that will give you
the home theatre experience on your PC. Submitted by "DIVX
Budman."

* Coldfusion: A futuristic skin design dripping in coolness.

My French is a bit iffy these days, but if this is true, does it not also
nullify Microsoft, Adobe and WinZip licences amongst most others? These all
claim no liability, no guarantees (M$ say delivered "with all faults", so
at least they are honest).

Apparently the angle on this (i.e. selling without guarantee) is that
software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at
least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing
no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed, you could
always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

The question is, why does 2.40 do this whereas my 2.31 doesn't. Hmmm.

yep, I reckon that's likely.

- looks like there may be a razor2 issue

I think this is a Razor bug/glitch triggered when file permissions
don't allow its own log system to work. At least that's the report
I heard on the Razor list in the past...

Theo, does it work now that you /dev/null'd the logfile?

- version number (says "cvs")
- tag tree as "Rel" this time too

I won't bother tagging with Rel, IMO; I don't think we should
rely on the version control system inside our code, so I've just
put a line in Mail/SpamAssassin.pm instead. I will of course
tag with a release *label* though.

This was thoroughly confusing, but by playing musical chairs with the spamd

OK:
spamd --debug --daemonize --auto-whitelist --username=nobody --allowed-ips=1

NOT OK:
spamd --debug --daemonize --auto-whitelist --username=nobody --allowed-ips=1

fwiw, I can't reproduce this with

spamd --debug --auto-whitelist --allowed-ips="127.0.0.1"
spamd --debug --auto-whitelist --allowed-ips="127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.1"
spamd --debug --auto-whitelist --allowed-ips="192.168.1.1, 127.0.0.1"

which I presume is what you meant (except for the missing args
of course). They all seem to work OK.

Thank you Lars for your reply to my query.

SA doesnt do any of these. It is probably a function of whatever scanning
system/MDA
you're using (amavis, procmail, whatever). What exactly are you using?

I am using SpamAssassin as part of the MailScanner package (using sendmail
as the MTA). It integrates nicely in there, and shares a configuration file
with SA. All very neat.

SA in itself does nothing really. You need a frontend (procmail, amavis,
etc)
at some point in the mail delivery chain that can hand over the message
to SA and do whatever other processing you want.

I thought that SA rated a message with a certain score, then did a certain
action (such as store | deliver | delete) based on the configuration given.
I was hoping there were some other actions that I could custom-program in.

Again, many thanks,

Adrian

Perl doesn't complain that it can't find PerMsgStatus.pm but the function

from another device, something with more than one Ethernet port would be
nice.
anybody got any recommendations ?

It seems to only support PPPoA and not PPPoE. You need one that supports
PPPoE, if you want torun it in routed IP mode. If you are using it as a
bridge, it'll probably work, but you'd be left leaving the computer on,
which would defeat the purpose of getting a router.

The best router I've come accross is the Zyxel 643. Eircom supply this,
but if you have alook online you can probably find it cheaper to buy
online from America or the UK.

Hope this is useful,

"Kerry Nice" said:

What about some reality check rules. Yeah, you can pack in lots of things
into the header to try and get some negative points, but do they all make
sense in combination. Can you have a Pine message id in the same header
with an Outlook Express one or a Mutt User-Agent?

Yes, this is a big bonus of meta rules (new in 2.40); we can now
e.g. check for an Outlook-style forwarded message, and not give
it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from
Outlook.

I think the headers should be paid special attention to. The message
content of something from the NY Times or Lockergnome might look spammy, but
usually they don't forge or fake anything in the header. Tone down the
negative scores and ding them extra for any obvious forgeries.

When we get more (good) "nice" tests, the GA will assign lower
scores to them. I think the current problem is that there are
very few really good nice tests in the current rulebase, and lots
of +ve tests that those newsletters hit, giving the GA a big
problem to solve.

BTW, I've been thinking a little about the RPMs and other packages.
Already the PLD guys are distributing 3 rpms:

- perl-Mail-SpamAssassin

the perl modules.

- spamassassin

the "spamassassin" and "spamd" scripts,
spamd rc-file etc.

- spamassassin-tools

mass-check, masses directory stuff, etc.
for generating rescore data from corpora.

This seems like a good way to do it; this way, stuff which just needs
the perl modules doesn't need to require the full RPM be installed,
with RC files in init.d etc.

It's been adopted in the distributed .spec file, anyway.

Theo, BTW, what's the eval test you add in the tvd version of the RPM?

It's possible...I performed the update via "rpm -U"...which, of course,

Anyone else run into this problem?

you look to have 2 versions of spamd installed. The one running from
the RC script is pre-2.4 (there is a -H now, and -F has been removed),
but the one you run from the commandline seems to be a 2.4x version.

I would find that old version of SA and blow it away.

I've searched the 'net, and it seems that Notes can only filter based on
the "visible" headers, i.e. sender, subject, precedence, etc. Is there
any way to filter based on X- headers?

=> Yes the only way out with Notes looks like changing the subject
(subject_tag).

I got the DSL-W 906E from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk.

Though it's not at all the best one around I have to say it does the job
and a bit. Some of the features can be a pain to get working (ie. pptp in
pppoe mode - can't figure it out). The documentation is not the best, but
the guys from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk will help you ouit. They
also have a message board.

The command line interface is quite powerful, but absolutely not
userfriendly.

All in all it's a cheap desent performer, that I am happy enough with.
Got this one including a microfilter (not needed) for 140euro including
shipping. Better than any deal from Eircom.

LESSON 2: COMPANIES GONE WRONG

Instructors: Bill Mann, TMF Otter (with Matt Richey, TMF Matt)
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690055
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690056

In Lesson 1, we offered a list of red flags that trigger instant
sales. These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with
current events surrounding the companies you hold.

Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing
Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one
reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly
don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems.

Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have
significantly more access to business management than we ever
will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable
insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of
company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond
market (more on this later). "Strong buy?" Pfffffft.

In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is
slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly
valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large
share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple
of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is
priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple
company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business
starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows,
whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular,
it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a
company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals.

So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to
go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning
signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens.

WARNING SIGN 1: SLOWING SALES GROWTH
Through 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of
the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best
capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the
market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted
revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April
2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the
next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E)
company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in
a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a
barnburner like Nokia, one is enough.

Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest
sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they
always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then
canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If
you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and
they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell
trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give
a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on
the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a
year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a
year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly
growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew
sequential growth.)

WARNING SIGN 2: DIVERGENT SALES AND PROFIT GROWTH
By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs
were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies
growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom
lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales
were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end
of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70%
to 40%.

Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to
collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics
changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock
reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the
technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see
signs that something was wrong.

WARNING SIGN 3: PLUMMETING CASH FLOWS
In 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings
perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look
at two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free
cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have
significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash
flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999,
Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion,
based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the
world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications
equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690057
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690058

But as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were
afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an
operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost
$276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in
reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than
$2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference
between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating
cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3
billion, and not in a good way.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690059

The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have
saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999,
Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but
twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow
is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.)

And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on
Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they
weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.

WARNING SIGN 4: WATCH THOSE BONDS
Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's
because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's
almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best
interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the
same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.

Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally
paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the
current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds
bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I
recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of
the bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders
are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same
time analysts are shouting, "Strong buy!"
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690060
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690061

I recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company
and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity
between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced
at 100 is at "par," which means that the bond's face-value
interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some
bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be
lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk.
But some are priced below face value, even way below.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690062

As of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at
18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance
they'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent
problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with
2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not
one that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports
a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than
Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they
don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.

WARNING SIGN 5: "IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER"
For a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the
largest company in the world by market capitalization. This
should have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the
stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion
implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach
$34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings
higher than $12 billion in a single year.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690063

As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco --
it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that
article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any
better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no
signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000,
Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8
billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of
53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then
66% higher.

Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine
a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for
future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the
midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As
investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities.
Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this
point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business
was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot
has to be right for the situation to work out.

HOMEWORK
For this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after
Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you
looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company,
do the following:

- Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four
quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating,
staying about the same, or weakening?

- Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past
four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing
slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures?

- Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past
three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net
income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look
at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around
due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much
more indicative of real cash flow trends.)

- If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center
and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know
whether your company has any debt, just type your company name
into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690064

- Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its
current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is
there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario
already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market,
this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's
still a question you should consider.)

The Motley Fool Online Seminar: When To Sell: The Foolish Selling Strategy

Lesson 2: Companies Gone Wrong

Instructors:

Bill Mann, TMF Otter (with Matt Richey, TMF Matt)

In Lesson 1, we offered a list of red flags that trigger instant sales. These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with current events surrounding the companies you hold.
Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems.

Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have significantly more access to business management than we ever will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond market (more on this later). "Strong buy?" Pfffffft.

In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows, whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular, it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals.

So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens.

Warning sign 1: Slowing sales growth Through 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April 2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E) company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a barnburner like Nokia, one is enough.

Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew sequential growth.)

Warning sign 2: Divergent sales and profit growth By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70% to 40%.

Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see signs that something was wrong.

Warning sign 3: Plummeting cash flowsIn 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look at two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999, Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion, based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.

But as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost $276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3 billion, and not in a good way.

The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999, Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.)

And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.

Warning sign 4: Watch those bonds Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.

Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of the bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same time analysts are shouting, "Strong buy!"

I recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced at 100 is at "par," which means that the bond's face-value interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk. But some are priced below face value, even way below.

As of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance they'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not one that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.

Warning sign 5: "It just doesn't get any better" For a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the largest company in the world by market capitalization. This should have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach $34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings higher than $12 billion in a single year.

As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco -- it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000, Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8 billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of 53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then 66% higher.

Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities. Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot has to be right for the situation to work out.

HomeworkFor this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company, do the following:

Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating, staying about the same, or weakening?

Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures?

Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much more indicative of real cash flow trends.)

If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know whether your company has any debt, just type your company name into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)

Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market, this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's still a question you should consider.)

To help you out, we've put together the Foolish Stock Information Form to track all of your research and information about your stocks. You can get to by clicking here. We've also outlined how to find all of the information above, here.

So dust off the old calculator, find your company's financials, and get to work. Quarterly financial data is best found in company 10-Qs, and annual data is best found in company 10-Ks. You should be able to find all of this information using financials from either the company website or at Fool.com on the Quotes & Data area.

In case you missed this week's earlier announcement, please note that there is a correction to Lesson 1.

The fifth automatic sell rule regarding stock option grants should read:

We set 3% as our maximum for developed companies, 5% for developing ones (use $500 million in sales as a rough boundary between the two).

You can read the correct lesson in its entirety by clicking on "Lesson 1" below.

from others when you could count on your own

A New Theory on Mapping the New World

By Guy Gugliotta
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, October 7, 2002; Page A07

In 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary map
of the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus and
others into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent
"America." With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.
But there was something else. What would later come to be called South
America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the
east coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast
-- which no European was known to have seen.
The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of
modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right
geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed
along its top.
The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the
curvature of the Earth.
It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12
large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was
published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of
Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the
world.
Did someone get there earlier?

Seriously though, it spurs the question: should this list be moderated ?
(and the next question: if "yes", who wants to co-moderate ?)

No...the list has been on target i'd say about 95% of the time.
Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's
right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
requests have in the entire past year.

One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's
adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message
indicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is
not sent to "majordomo" - it is sent to "listname-remove"@domain.
I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail
addr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in
a received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the
same box).

For all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal
instructions right in the bottom of your email, you will
_still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (Trust me,
we've been there.)

Dear Fool,

Just before Enron plunged...

...16 of 17 Wall Street analysts were still urging you
to buy Enron's stock. While the company piled up debt
and manufactured imaginary earnings, auditors gave the
balance sheet a big thumbs-up. As investors lost
everything, Enron insiders pocketed millions.

AND THAT should make every investor's blood boil!

Frankly, the Enrons and Global Crossings of the world
infuriate me. All the backroom manipulations dirty
dealing and cover-ups really make it hard to know who
you can trust. And that is why we've created a NEW
investing service, "David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool
Stock Advisor" -- to bring the Motley Fool co-founders'
extraordinary commitment to honest stock analysis,
fair dealing and complete disclosure to investors like
you on a regular and timely basis.

The Motley Fool, which David and Tom founded back in
1993, is dedicated to the principle that given the
right tools...the average guy can find great success in
every aspect of his financial life.

And now, David and Tom are applying this principle -- and
their extensive investing experience -- to the new
"Motley Fool Stock Advisor."

But as you'll see, this service isn't just about
"buying more stocks." OUR GOAL in publishing the
"Motley Fool Stock Advisor" is twofold: To help you
gain the knowledge, confidence and resolve to make
money in the U.S. stock market...while avoiding the
biggest mistakes, as well.

The Wall Street analysts touting Global Crossing said
its worldwide fiber-optics network would make it the
king of telecom. Now these shares are WORTH NOTHING.
Microstrategy was the poster child of the technology
bubble-after earnings restatements, the stock now sits
99% OFF its high! Kmart's lousy inventory management
and marketing incompetence helped drive the company
into BANKRUPTCY.

WHAT ABOUT Nortel and Lucent-two of America's most
widely owned stocks. Will they ever come back? How
about AOL? Does its merger with Time-Warner mean the
GLORY DAYS are over -- or have they just begun? Are 90%
of all telecommunications companies truly in danger of
disappearing? If so, which will survive? Will great
old names like JP Morgan, Disney and Motorola recover?

Well, those are the sorts of questions David & Tom
Gardner can help you answer at the "Motley Fool Stock
Advisor."

As they say, "Show us the money." When it comes to
making promises, fast-talkers can fudge just about
anything. But CASH FLOW doesn't lie.

YOU CAN avoid a lot of big mistakes by simply making
sure a company has the cash coming in to pay its
bills. And watching cash flow is also one of the best
ways to identify superstar companies -- far more reliable
than "earnings" that can be manipulated 8 ways to
Sunday. Once you eliminate big losers from the
equation -- and target the true superstars -- you'll find
investing more fun...less stressful...and much more
profitable, as well.

So forget about Wall Street's "damaged goods"-
companies that have a boatload of debt and accounting
woes, as well. Keep it SIMPLE instead.

"Simple" means investing in companies that we all -- with
a little effort -- can understand. Companies where we
know what businesses they're really in. Companies
where the financial statements actually mean
something. And companies easily recognizable as the
"best of breed."

In the free report you received, "The One Stock That
Keeps Wall Street BUZZING," you read about one of
David & Tom's very favorite investments: Starbucks.
Before this company came along, most folks just took
coffee for granted. And certainly, no one proposed
any far-reaching business model built around it. Yet
these innovators took a low-margin commodity and built
a near $3 BILLION company with more than 5000
retail outfits all around the world.

Starbucks has been able to open new outlets based on
money it has earned from existing ones. That is an
astounding testament to its economic power. At The
Motley Fool Stock Advisor we'll help you find and
truly understand the great investments, the companies
with solid balance sheets and real growth prospects.
Right now we're following companies such as:

*America's most prestigious jeweler -- its brand name
has no rival. With net margins of 59% on sales of
$1.6 Billion, this company is a great pick for solid
returns with low risk.

*This software company commands more than 25% of the
video game market. Its shares have returned 6,000%
since its public debut in 1989. An investment of
$5,000 in 1989 is now worth over $300,000. The video
game market is expected to double by 2005 with this
company enjoying the lion's share of the growth.

*This premier credit rating company has locked-in
demand for its reports on the creditworthiness of
borrowers holding $30 trillion of the world's debt.
It has a 20-year record of consistent sales and income
growth and is poised for another stellar year.

YOU CAN TRY the "Motley Fool Stock Advisor" for six
full months 100% RISK-FREE. If we don't prove its
worth to you, it doesn't cost you a dime.

Sincerely yours,

Mike Bell, Publisher
"David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool Stock Advisor"

P.S. Do you like BIG PROFITS? In 1994, investment
pros sniffed at America Online's high-flying stock and
screamed, "Overvalued." But the Gardners saw three
things they overlooked: 1) AOL was building the
premier stop in cyberspace; 2) They had a great
retention strategy; and 3) Millions of members paying
$$$ every month.

So Tom and David bought it. And today they're sitting
on whopping 4,120% gains. So you see, while they do
structure their investing strategy to avoid big
blunders...they do make a lot of money, too. To try the
"Motley Fool Stock Advisor" RISK-FREE, click here now:

Looks great! One note: most "image-only" spam actually has some text (a few
words at the top, a disclaimer at the end) so keep that in mind. The typical
image spam that slips through SA seems to have a bit of text, one huge image,
then a bit more.

Summary: Split up FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS
Product: Spamassassin
Version: unspecified
Platform: Other
OS/Version: other
Status: NEW
Severity: enhancement
Priority: P2
Component: Rules
AssignedTo: spamassassin-devel@example.sourceforge.net
ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com

The current FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS triggers on any from where the user name ends
in two or more digits. I think this should be split up into different
numbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can
get different scores. So I've made test rules that look from From
names that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or
more digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a
single digit, just the sake of completeness.

Here is what I got:

OVERALL% SPAM% NONSPAM% S/O RANK SCORE NAME
15113 4797 10316 0.32 0.00 0.00 (all messages)
100.000 31.741 68.259 0.32 0.00 0.00 (all messages as %)
1.244 3.877 0.019 1.00 0.64 0.01 T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS6
0.576 1.459 0.165 0.90 0.43 0.01 T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS5
4.982 10.694 2.326 0.82 0.38 0.01 T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS4

8.847 6.817 9.791 0.41 0.22 0.01 T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS1

I should note that I get rather bad S/O's for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS, probably
because so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo! Groups traffic, which
seems to have a lot of users that like sticking numbers at the ends of their
names. Here is the normal stats for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS:

7.024 28.480 2.834 0.91 0.50 0.88 FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS

and my stats:

19.228 34.793 11.991 0.74 0.35 0.88 FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS

I'll take a look at it. I'm sure there's got to be some reasonly easy way to

I too am seeing very weird things with 2.42 and AWL. I installed a
fresh system, and then ran a bunch of test spam through it (all from the
same user). All messages should have scored over 15. The AWL kept
adjusting them down so that after about 10 message I had a negative
score. I'm using spamc/d.

That's exactly what is intended; the idea is that legit senders who
habitually score just > 5, will eventually get out of "AWL hell" after
6-10 messages.

Note that running a single spam through "spamassassin -a -t" *will*
eventually whitelist the spammer. but that's why the man page tells you
not to do it ;)

This step is unneccesary -- unless you've changed the scripts
much, any test in the logs which aren't in the rules files will
just be ignored I think. You do seem to have changed the
logs-to-c script and removed the bit where you could specify
immutable tests at the top -- I took a brief glance through the
code and couldn't fully make out how it had changed. I think we
want to be able to specify immutable test scores though in there
somewhere -- or is that now handled by the tflags stuff? For
the last couple releases, any test which occurred infrequently
(by thumb-in-the-wind subjective criteria) I set to have
immutable scores, as well as a handful of other rules.

5. kick off the GA

Shouldn't be a problem. Assuming I can get the darned thing to

I'm gonna fix this one. I think the best solution will be to copy the modified
rules to blib and install them from there. Then the rules files will be
changed on build time and not install time, too.

FWIW, I would now recommend doing this (using a user with a procmailrc)

* EFF Submits Letter to FCC Chairman Regarding BPDG Proposal

The Honorable Michael K. Powell Chairman Federal Communications
Commission 445 12th Street, S.W. Suite 8C453 Washington, DC 20554

BY FACSIMILE, ELECTRONIC MAIL, AND POSTAL MAIL

Dear Chairman Powell:

I am writing to you today in regards to the digital television
Broadcast Flag; specifically, I write in response to Sen. Hollings'
and Representatives Dingell and Tauzin's letters of July 19, which
urged you to mandate the Broadcast Flag proposal outlined in the
final report of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported
non-profit organization that works to uphold civil liberties
interests in technology policy and law. EFF has played a critical
role in safeguarding crucial freedoms related to computers, the
Internet and consumer electronics devices, defeating the restriction
on strong cryptography exports; securing the legal principle that
Internet wiretaps must only proceed in conjunction with a warrant;
and defending academics, researchers and commercial interests
against DMCA-related prosecution.

EFF was an active participant in the Broadcast Protection Discussion
Group. We attended the group's meetings and conference calls and
participated in the group's policy and technical mailing-lists. EFF
also maintains a web-site that was and is the only public source of
information on the Broadcast Flag negotiations and proposal. The
site can be found at http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org. EFF devoted
thousands of staff-hours to publicizing the existence and nature of
the BPDG to the public, to civil liberties and consumer-advocacy
groups, and to entrepreneurial companies and software authors whose
products were threatened by the proceedings.

When you and I met at Esther Dyson's PC Forum last March, we spoke
briefly about the civil liberties interests that would be undermined
by the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group's mandate. The BPDG
proposal will have grave consequences for innovation, free
expression, competition and consumer interests. Worst of all, it
will add unnecessary complexity and expense to the DTV transition,
compromising DTV adoption itself.

As you are aware, technologists have traditionally manufactured
those devices they believed would be successful in the market, often
in spite of the misgivings of rights-holders. From the piano roll to
the PVR, technologists have enjoyed the freedom to ship whatever
products they believe the public will pay for; what's more,
innovation has always thrived best where there were the fewest
regulatory hurdles. NTSC tuners and devices are governed by precious
few regulations, and consequently we see a rich field of products
that interact with them, from the VCR Plus to tuner-cards for PCs to
the PVR. The Broadcast Flag proposal would limit technologists to
shipping those products that met with the approval of MPAA member
companies. No entrepreneur or software author will know, a priori,
whether his innovative DTV product will be legal in the market until
he has gone to the expense of building it and taking it around to
the Hollywood studios for review.

Consumers and industry alike have benefitted greatly from the "Open
Source" or "Free Software" movement, in which technologies are
distributed in a form that encourages end-user modification. From
server-software like the web-wide success-story apache, to operating
systems like GNU/Linux, to consumer applications like the Mozilla
browser, Free Software is a powerful force for innovation, consumer
benefit and commercial activity. The BPDG proposal implicitly bans
Free Software DTV applications -- such as the DScaler de-interlacer
and the GNU Radio software-defined radio program -- as these
applications are built to be modified by end-users, something that
is banned under the BPDG proposal. The tamper-resistance component
of the BPDG's "Robustness Requirements" will create and entire class
of illegal software applications, abridging the traditional First
Amendment freedom enjoyed by software authors who create expressive
speech in code form under one of several Free Software/Open Source
licenses.

The BPDG nominally set out to create an objective standard, a bright
line that technologists could hew to in order to avoid liability
when deploying their products. However, the end product of the BPDG
was a "standard" that contained no objective criteria for legal
technology; rather, the standard required that new technologies be
approved by MPAA member companies. Not uncoincidentally, the only
technologies that were approved by the MPAA -- and hence the only
legal technologies -- were those produced by the 4C and 5C
consortia, a group of technology companies that acted as the MPAA's
allies throughout the BPDG process. This is an harbinger of the sort
of regime that the BPDG standard will usher in: technology companies
will be able to shut their competitors out of the marketplace by
allying themselves with Hollywood, brokering deals to allow certain
technologies and outlaw others.

The marketplace is a proven mechanism for rapidly and efficiently
producing products that increase the value and desirability of new
technologies, such as DTV. A BPDG mandate would subvert the market
for DTV innovation. Competing companies with lower-cost DTV
technology alternatives would be restrained from bringing these to
market if they failed to assuage the MPAA's concerns about
unauthorized redistribution. Furthermore, the universe of
unauthorized-but-lawful uses for DTV programming will be shrunk down
to the much smaller space of explicitly authorized uses. The ability
of the public to make unauthorized-but-lawful uses of television
programming has been an historical force for increasing the value of
broadcast programming, from the VCR to the PVR.

Ironically, the inevitable damage that a Broadcast Flag mandate
would do to innovation, competition and consumer interests can only
slow down DTV adoption, by driving up the cost of DTV devices while
reducing the number of desirable features that an open market would
create. If the public is offered less functionality for more money,
they will not flock to DTV.

The most disheartening thing about the Broadcast Flag is that there
is neither a strong case that the Broadcast Flag is a necessary tool
for protecting copyright, nor that the Broadcast Flag would be
effective in that role. The existing practice of Internet
infringement of broadcast programming -- analog captures from
devices that satisfy the requirements of the BPDG proposal -- would
not be stopped by the presence of a Broadcast Flag.
Higher-resolution DTV signals will likewise present no challenge to
determined infringers, who can capture full-quality analog signal
from DTV devices and then re-digitize them, suffering only a single
generation's worth of loss-of-quality before the programming enters
the Internet.

Meanwhile, the underlying rubric for a Broadcast Flag -- that
infringement will undermine Hollywood's business to the point that
movies will no longer be available to the public, reducing the value
of DTV -- is no more than superstition. No credible study or
analysis, undertaken by a neutral party, has ever been presented to
Congress, the FCC, the CPTWG or the BPDG supporting this notion. The
public is being asked to sacrifice its rights in copyright; industry
is being asked to place its right to innovation in the hands of
entertainers; the US government is being asked to mandate
extraordinary, unprecedented regulation of the $600 billion
technology sector -- all on the uncorroborated opinions of a few
studio executives.

EFF welcomes the FCC's oversight of the Broadcast Flag issue. The
BPDG proceedings took place behind a shroud of secrecy, in a
looking-glass "public process" where only those participants the
organizers wanted to hear from were made privy to its existence,
where the co-chairs invented rules and processes on the fly to suit
the needs of the entertainment interests and the technology
companies that had privately secured a promise of a legal monopoly
for their products, where the press was banned.

The FCC has an admirable tradition of seeking and weighing public
opinion in its proceedings. As the FCC considers the Broadcast Flag,
EFF hopes that it will start anew, setting aside the findings of the
BPDG in light of the concerns raised by Microsoft, Philips, Sharp,
Thomson, and Zenith, as well as non-profit organizations including
EFF, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, the Free
Software Foundation, Public Knowledge, digitalconsumer.org, the
Center for Democracy in Technology, and the Computer and
Communications Industry Association.

Thank you for attention in this matter. Please let me know if we can
be of any further assistance to you.

Sincerely yours,

Cory Doctorow for the Electronic Frontier Foundation

* Update on Intel Corp. v. Hamidi

Intel Corp. v. Hamidi is now on appeal to the California Supreme
Court. EFF filed an amicus brief in support of Ken Hamidi on Aug. 6,
2002. The facts are simple: Over about two years, Hamidi on six
occasions sent e-mail critical of Intel's employment practices to
between 8,000 and 35,000 Intel employees. Intel demanded that Hamidi
stop, but he refused. Intel obtained an injunction barring Hamidi
from e-mailing Intel employees at their Intel e-mail addresses,
based on the common-law tort of "trespass to chattels." ("Chattel"
is a legal term that refers to personal property, as opposed to
property in land.)

EFF's amicus brief argues three main points.

(1) Intel did not qualify for relief under "trespass to chattels"
because Intel's e-mail servers were not themselves harmed by
Hamidi's e-mails. If Intel was harmed, it was because the content of
Hamidi's e-mails affected Intel employees, not because sending the
e-mails affected the functioning of Intel's servers.

(2) By focusing on unwanted "contact" with the chattel and ignoring
the harm requirement, the court of appeal turned "trespass to
chattels" into a doctrine that threatens common Internet activity
like search engines and linking. For example, if a website posted a
"no trespassing" sign, any "contact" by a search engine could be
considered a trespass even if it caused no harm.

(3) The court of appeal wrongly held that the injunction did not
infringe Hamidi's freedom of speech. The First Amendment limits
private parties' legal remedies in many areas of law, such as libel,
out of concern that private parties will use the law to suppress
criticism. The same principle should apply here, where Intel's
claims of harm stem from the meaning of Hamidi's speech.

* DeCSS Author Johansen's Trial Rescheduled

The trial of Norwegian teen Jon Johansen, who created the
controversial DeCSS software, has been pushed back again. It is now
scheduled to be heard on December 9, 2002, in Oslo, Norway. In the
fall of 1999, Johansen and his team reverse-engineered the content
scrambling system (CSS) software used to encrypt DVDs in an effort
to build a DVD player for the Linux operating system. In January of
2002, the Norwegian Economic Crime Unit (OKOKRIM) charged Johansen
with a violation of Norwegian Criminal Code Section 145.2, which
outlaws breaking into a third-party's property in order to steal
data that one is not entitled to. This prosecution marks the first
time the law will be used to prosecute a person for accessing his
own property (his own DVD). Johansen faces two years in prison if
convicted. The prosecution is based on a formal complaint filed by
the Motion Picture Association.

The trial had originally been scheduled to take place in June of
2002 but was rescheduled when the court could not find any qualified
judges to hear Johansen's case. Now the case is scheduled to be
heard by a three-judge panel. Help Jon in his battle against
Hollywood movie studios, donate to his legal defense fund at:

* Bunnie Presents Paper on XBox Reverse Engineering

Paper Explains Flaw in Videogame Security System

Researcher Escapes Chilling Effect of Digital Copyright Law

Electronic Frontier Foundation Media Advisory

For Immediate Release: Thursday, August 9, 2002

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is pleased
to announce that former MIT doctoral student Andrew "Bunnie" Huang
will present a paper explaining a security flaw in the Microsoft
Xbox (TM) videogame system.

Huang will present his paper, "Keeping Secrets in Hardware: the
Microsoft X-BOX Case Study," at 5:25 p.m. PDT on August 13, 2002, at
the 2002 Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems
(CHES 2002) in Redwood City, California (Aug. 13-15, 2002).

The Xbox security system is intended to allow people to play only
videogames authorized by Microsoft. Huang's paper "shows how a
person could defeat that system with a small hardware investment,"
said MIT Professor Hal Abelson, one of Huang's advisors. "More
importantly, the paper relates the security vulnerability to a
general design flaw shared by other high-profile security systems
such as the government's Clipper Chip and the movie industry's
Contents Scrambling System (CSS) for DVD players."

Huang contacted EFF in March after his advisors told him that his
preliminary findings raised potentially significant legal questions.
With the help of Boston College law professor Joe Liu, EFF worked
with Huang, Abelson, and MIT administrators to analyze the legal
issues and draft letters notifying Microsoft of Huang's research
findings and intended publication, one of the steps encouraged by
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

Microsoft told Huang and Abelson that while it might prefer that the
paper not be published, it would be inappropriate to ask MIT to
withhold the paper.

"Microsoft deserves praise for making no attempt to control
publication," said Abelson. "Their response shows that they value
academic freedom, and that they appreciate the critical role of
unfettered research and publication in advancing technology."

Other companies have reacted otherwise, using the DMCA to threaten
researchers. The Recording Industry Association of America last year
warned Princeton Professor Edward Felten after his research team
exposed weaknesses in digital music security technologies. Last
month, Hewlett Packard (HP) threatened research collective SnoSoft
over exposing a security vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix operating
system. Soon after, HP clarified that it would not use the DMCA to
stifle research or impede the flow of information that would improve
computer security.

Huang said that while he is glad he can openly present his paper,
"The DMCA clearly had a chilling effect on my work. I was afraid to
submit my research for peer review until after the EFF's efforts to
clear potential legal restraints."

"Researchers should be analyzing security, not worrying about
getting sued," said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien.

* Baen Books expands fair-use-friendly e-book program

Baen Books will bind a CD-ROM into the October 2002 hardcover
edition of *War of Honor,* the latest volume in David Weber's epic
Honor Harrington space-opera. The CD will contain at least 22
complete novels, all in open formats like html and RTF, with the
fair-use-friendly admonishment "This disk and its contents may be
copied and shared but NOT sold." Included on the disk are the entire
Honor Harrington series to date, as well as other titles from the
Baen line, including Keith Laumer's *Retief!* and Larry Niven and
Jerry Pournelle's *Fallen Angels*.

Baen has been a banner-carrier for fair-use in electronic
publishing, shipping text and html files that can be played on a
multitude of devices. Other publishers have chosen to publish their
material in copy-controlled formats that make it impossible to
legally loan or resell the titles you purchase, are locked to a
specific device, can't play on every operating system, and
occasionally lock out assistive technology like the screen-readers
employed by the blind.

Dmitry Skylarov, a Russian scientist, was arrested in July 2001, for
demonstrating how end-users could defeat the copy-prevention
employed by Adobe's e-book technology. Adobe asked the FBI to arrest
Skylarov for violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),
which makes it a crime to describe techniques for circumventing
copy-prevention technology. Though Skylarov was later released, his
employer, ElcomSoft, is still facing charges in the USA, and the
Russian government has issued an advisory warning Russian scientists
to steer clear of American technical conferences until the DMCA is
repealed.

Here is Baen's statement on the CD release:

You are about to start playing with a CD-ROM that has fairly
extraordinary content. As of this writing it includes twenty-two
UNENCRYPTED novels in several formats, the ten Honor Harrington
Novels, 3 Honor Harrington Anthologies and 9 novels by friends of
Honor, and by the time of distribution it may well contain more.
(More than twenty novels for free, and with no stupid codes to work
around. Think of that.) The reason for the plethora of formats is to
try to please the people who want to read the novels on their Palm
Pilots or other text-specialized palm-sized devices.

------- Additional Comments From alan@rdrop.com 2002-09-05 22:22 -------
I haven't tried 2.41 yet because it requires File::Spec, which barfs when
spamassassin tries to use it. I haven't filed a bug yet because I suspect it's
because I'm still running 5.005 perl because of reported compatibility issues
with 5.6 and later, but I probably will because I think there's too much legacy
perl code to put up with major compatibility problems, and spamassassin didn't,
at least in the quickest of looks, say it needed a newer one. The perl @ stuff
was bad enough... but this is all a separate soapbox...

(Please feel free to forward this message to other possibly-interested
parties.)

Some caveats (in decending order of concern):

1. These messages could end up being falsely (or incorrectly) reported
to Razor, DCC, Pyzor, etc. Certain RBLs too. I don't think the
results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way,
shape, or form when running over a public corpus.

2. These messages could also be submitted (more than once) to projects
like SpamAssassin that rely on filtering results submission for GA
tuning and development.

3. Spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off
filters. And, of course, there's always progression in technology
(by both spammers and non-spammers).

The second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsa
signature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format used
by SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 or
SHA-1 of each file).

The third problem doesn't really worry me.

These problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are unique
to spam filtering. Compression corpuses and other performance-related
corpuses have their own set of problems, of course.

In other words, I don't think there's any replacement for having
multiple independent corpuses. Finding better ways to distribute
testing and collate results seems like a more viable long-term solution
(and I'm glad we're working on exactly that for SpamAssassin). If
you're going to seriously work on filter development, building a corpus
of 10000-50000 messages (half spam/half non-spam) is not really that
much work. If you don't get enough spam, creating multi-technique
spamtraps (web, usenet, replying to spam) is pretty easy. And who
doesn't get thousands of non-spam every week? ;-)

OK; maybe rewriting the message-ids will help here, that should allow

Yep. The primary reason I released this, was to provide a good, big
corpus for academic testing of filter systems; it allows results to
be compared between filters using a known corpus.

For SpamAssassin development, everyone has to maintain their own corpus.

The real question is: is there a way to run razor without this overhead?
Even some sort of razord you could talk to over a unix socket would do.
Until I can find one, I cannot spare the resources to run razor at all :(

**Cypherpunks**: Tax havens and offshore islands are not quite as ''free''
-- at least in terms of personal liberties -- as people might think. R.
A. Hettinga tells some stories about ''Triumph, the Fabulous
Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Customs Wonder Dog, ... and (the Cayman-born
expat's kid) who was literally exiled from the island when the island
constabulary "discovered" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break

I guess it's back to the oil rigs then ;)

Clearly you've never met "Triumph", the Fabulous Crotch-Sniffing
Caymanian Customs Wonder Dog at extreme close range, or heard the
story about the expat's college age kid, actually born on Cayman, who
was literally exiled from the island when the island constabulary
"discovered" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break rental car
a few years back.

I mean, his old man was some senior cheese at Global Crossing at the
time, but this was back when they could do no wrong. If that's what
they did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former
junk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd
unauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty
keeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a
bottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting
nocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't
help thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman
van's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't
gonna be pretty.

Closer to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were
hustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on
Grand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple
of years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active
shooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a
few days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff,
reeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal
examinations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two,
courtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and
games with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog.
Heck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed
Caymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left.

Besides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their
activities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too
much in the way of "escaped" "revenue", or at least the perception of
same in the local "free" press. Obviously, if your money "there"
isn't exchangeable into your money "here", it kind of defeats the
purpose of keeping your money "there" in the first place, giving
folks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up
for renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line
credit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or
quango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and
the US.

As a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while
ago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom
on that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes
Luxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually
accessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans
themselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling
about one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing
pretexts.

At this point, the "legal", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings
are kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep
my money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where
a bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will
close it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned
statutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or
imagined property rights are this afternoon.

The point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only
solution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private
transactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than "transparent"
transactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real*
interesting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal
freedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and
groom action figures sold separately, of course.

Cheers,
RAH
(Who went to FC2K at the Grand Cayman Marriott in February that year.
Nice place, I liked Anguilla better though, at least at the time, and
I haven't been back to either since. The beaches are certainly better
in Anguilla, and the "private" banking system there is probably just
as porous as Cayman's is, by this point. If I were to pick up and
move Somewhere Free outside Your Friendly Neighborhood Unipolar
Superpower, New Zealand is somewhere near the top of my list, and
Chile would be next, though things change quickly out there in
ballistic-missile flyover country. In that vein, who knows, maybe
we're in for some kind of latter-day Peloponnesian irony, and
*Russia* will end up the freest place on earth someday. Stranger
things have happened in the last couple of decades, yes?)

I'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail
problem. Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning
FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my
wife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few other
services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we
get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On
occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a
reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in
which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see
over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an
occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.

I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated
with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,
to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor
files. So I have just added "-home /etc/razor" as an argument. I
haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether
this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This
paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph
above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)

At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email
processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes? Is there,
perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?

Any ideas would be welcome.

Thanks,
Joe

See your /etc/sendmail.cf file, there are a number of methods for limiting
the number of concurrent sendmail processes, either by load average (I'm
sure), or concurrency (I think)... I use sendmail anymore (I use qmail) but
I'm sure that if you look in the config file, you will see what you need...

The following was personal correspondence between two people. I can't
fathom how Razor thinks it is spam:

We are struggling with the decisions related to wether or not to
go ahead with our plans to purchase an OCR and forms
scanning solution.

An outside consultant mentioned that he had heard that not to
long ago you folks were considering implementing OCR
technology to reduce data entry costs and improve efficiency.
If you could let us know if you did move foreward with any
plans in that direction it would be of great help to us. May I ask
what initialy prompted you to consider OCR? Did you decide it
could help your compamy? What software did you go with?
Would you recomend we take a look at it?
At present we are still planning to continue our research until
we decide which OCR system best suits our needs, then
implement it quickly.

If you are just starting to consider this
technology feel free to stay in touch. We will let you know what
we decide on and if it works for us.

If you cannot advise on this please forward this E-mail to the
proper individual in your company who might be able to help with
this.
Thanks,
Jay

your mail, and gives you only the non-spam. To train it, you'd only need
to send it the false negatives somehow; it can assume that anything is
ham that you don't say is spam within 48 hours.

I have folks who leave their email programs running 24 hours a day,
constantly polling for mail. If they go away for a long weekend,
lots of "friday night spam" will become ham on sunday night.
(Friday night seems to be the most popular time)

So we'll make this a config parameter.

- Your idea here.

Ultimately I'd like to see tight integration into the "most popular
email clients".. As a stop-gap to the auto-ham ..

What's an auto-ham?

How about adding an IMAP server with a spam and deleted-ham
folder. Most email clients can handle IMAP. Users should be able to
quickly move "spam" into the spam folder.

I personally don't think IMAP has a bright future, but for people who
do use it, that's certainly a good approach.

Instead of deleting messages (or, by reprogramming the delete
function) they can quickly move ham into the ham folder.

Yes.

--Guido van Rossum (home page: http://www.python.org/~guido/)
[Anthony Baxter]
I've got a test set here that's the last 3 and a bit years email to
info@ekit.com and info@ekno.com - it's a really ugly set of 20,000+
messages, currently broken into 7,000 spam, 9,000 ham, 9,000 currently
unclassified. These addresses are all over the 70-some different
ekit/ekno/ISIConnect websites, so they get a LOT of spam.

As well as the usual spam, it also has customers complaining about
credit card charges, it has people interested in the service and
asking questions about long distance rates, &c &c &c. Lots and lots
of "commercial" speech, in other words. Stuff that SA gets pretty
badly wrong.

Can this corpus be shared? I suppose not.

I'm currently mangling it by feeding all parts (text, html, whatever
else :) into the filters, as well as both a selected number of headers
(to, from, content-type, x-mailer), and also a list of (header,
count_of_header). This is showing up some nice stuff - e.g. the
X-uidl that stoopid spammers blindly copy into their messages.

If we ever have a shared corpus, an easy refactoring of timtest
should allow to plug in different tokenizers. I've only made three changes
to Graham's algorithm so far (well, I've made dozens -- only three survived
testing as proven winners), all the rest has been refining the tokenization
to provide better clues.

I did have Received in there, but it's out for the moment, as it causes
rates to drop.

That's ambiguous. Accuracy rates or error rates, ham or spam rates?

I'm also stripping out HTML tags, except for href="" and src="" - there's
so so much goodness in them (note that I'm only keeping the contents of
the attributes).

Mining embedded http/https/ftp thingies cut the false negative rate in half
in my tests (not keying off href, just scanning for anything that "looked
like" one); that was the single biggest f-n improvement I've seen. It
didn't change the false positive rate. So you know whether src added
additional power, or did you do both at once?

Guido> Takers? How is ESR's bogofilter packaged? SpamAssassin? The
Guido> Perl Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?

Dunno about the other tools, but SpamAssassin is a breeze to incorporate
into a procmail environment. Lots of people use it in many other ways. For
performance reasons, many people run a spamd process and then invoke a small
C program called spamc which shoots the message over to spamd and passes the
result back out. I think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fast
enough to not require such tricks (though I would consider changing the
pickle to an anydbm file).

Basic procmail usage goes something like this:

:0fw
| spamassassin -P

:0
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
$SPAM

Which just says, "Run spamassassin -P reinjecting its output into the
processing stream. If the resulting mail has a header which begins
"X-Spam-Status: Yes", toss it into the folder indicated by the variable
$SPAM.

SpamAssassin also adds other headers as well, which give you more detail
about how its tests fared. I'd like to see spambayes operate in at least
this way: do its thing then return a message to stdout with a modified set
of headers which further processing downstream can key on.

Skip

Did you want this on the list? I'm replying to the list..

OK, here's a refinement. Assuming very little spam comes through, we
only need to pick a small percentage of ham received as new training
ham to match the new training spam. The program could randomly select
a sufficient number of saved non-spam msgs and ask the user to
validate this selection. You could do this once a day or week (config
parameter).

IN THIS ISSUE:

01. Secure IE
02. Disk cleanup on XP
03. Thanks but no thanks
04. Mouseless way home
05. Kartoo
06. XP time feature
07. Leaf Peeper Alert
08. Saving scraps
09. Quick access
10. Don't believe your email

And What's Coming Up Next Week in NNT Premium

01. SECURE IE. For the past month or so, our Software Review Panel has
been giving a grueling test to Secure IE, a piece of software that blocks
Flash and pop-ups, prevents malicious file downloads, lets you customize
Security Zone settings as you browse dozens of Web sites simultaneously up
to five times faster with a tabbed interface, annotate Web page with sticky
notes and highlighter, and save complete Web pages, even secure server
(HTTPS) pages and archive online transaction receipts. For what we believe
is one of the most thorough reviews ever conducted on a single piece of
software, check out what our Panel had to say at
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/SoftwareReviews . For a free trial download,
visit http://www.secureie.com . And if this one sweeps you off your feet,
go to the NNT Store at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store and get a super
deal, just $17.50 if you order before September 14. With a 30-day
guarantee, what's to lose?

02. DISK CLEANUP ON XP. Windows XP users can do some fast cleaning chores
with Disk Cleanup. Access this tool from the Start menu by right clicking
on your hard drive. Then select Properties and click on the Disk Cleanup
button to determine how many files can be safely deleted.

03. THANKS BUT NO THANKS. Continuing our periodic feature of
less-than-useful sites on the Web: The International Center for Bathroom
Etiquette at http://www.icbe.org/ gets our recognition this issue. It says
it's working hard to bring you the latest in cutting edge research and
technology regarding bathroom etiquette. We'll resist some obvious puns.

. . . . .

West Virginia's Diane Stratton recommended NNT to some friends and is now
enjoying QuicKeys 2.0, a great Windows management software package. Diane
is our latest winner and you could be next. Just go to the NNT Web site at
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com and click on "Recommend NNT." Nothing could
be easier.

. . . . .

04. MOUSELESS WAY HOME. To go home quickly in Internet Explorer, touch F6
to highlight the Address Bar and type two periods (..) there. The Enter
key then takes you home.

05. KARTOO. Search engines are everywhere on the Internet but Kartoo at
http://www.kartoo.net is quite unusual. It's a meta search engine that
displays results on a map in the form of a ball. The larger the ball, the
more relevant the result. As you mouseover each result, site descriptions
are revealed. If all that sounds confusing, the explanation is more
complicated than the service itself. Just try it.

. . . . .

You should make it a habit to visit the NNT Store at
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store . We try to have several great products
there at a limited-time price much less than anywhere else on the Net.
Currently, you'll find excellent ebooks, a very effective popup stopper,
and the very useful utility described in item 01 above, along with the
usual opportunity to subscribe to NNT Premium and ArchivesExpress. Check
us out, you'll be glad you did.

. . . . .

06. XP TIME FEATURE. Windows XP added a nice feature that heretofore
required a separate software application. It will connect, either at a
programmed time or manually, to a time server via the Internet and reset
that often erroneous internal clock. Just click on the time in the systems
tray, go to Date and Time Properties and click the Internet Time tab.

07. LEAF PEEPER ALERT. A bit early, but soon the changing colors of autumn
will begin here in the U.S. For those who like to follow the display,
consider http://www.stormfax.com/foliage.htm for a comprehensive collection
of links and toll-free numbers to each state to determine peak color times.

08. SAVINGS SCRAPS. Some oldies are worth repeating. If you're working
with text in, for example, MS Word or WordPad, and would like a handy way
to save a portion for later easy retrieval, just select (highlight) it and
click/drag it to your desktop. When the newly created icon is clicked on,
it will show the application with which the scrap was created, along with
the first few words of the text. A double click opens the text in the
application with which it was created.

09. QUICK ACCESS. To go to a frequently used program, you may find
yourself drilling down to the desktop and searching out the shortcut
icon. Consider instead setting up a key combination that will provide
quick access without using the shortcut. Right click on the shortcut and
select Properties. In the Shortcut key window, select any key you can
remember and click OK. Ctrl+Alt and that key will open the application
whenever needed.

10. DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EMAIL. We've been asked about those emails with
virus attachments that appear to be coming from NNT, asking for a
confirmation of a subscription. Don't believe it, and don't open the
attachments. Maybe this exchange between NNT and Lyris (our mail manager)
will clear things up:

NNT: Is there anything that can be done about the current strains of virus
that implant on address books and randomly send email asking alleged
subscribers to verify their subscription (when they haven't subscribed at
all)? I've received some of these as well, and I know it's become a
widespread problem with other ezine publishers, creating a lot of ill will
all around. Is there some configuration that we could change to keep
these from going out except to legitimate subscribers?

Lyris: Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about this since it
isn't actually ListManager doing the sending. The real problem is that
people sometimes will add the "join" address to their address book and
that is what causes the problems. The best we can do is advise people not
to have their address books set to automatically add any email address
that they send a message to even once. The main culprit here seems to be
Outlook Express.

Dunno about the other tools, but SpamAssassin is a breeze to incorporate
into a procmail environment. Lots of people use it in many other ways. For
performance reasons, many people run a spamd process and then invoke a small
C program called spamc which shoots the message over to spamd and passes the
result back out. I think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fast
enough to not require such tricks (though I would consider changing the
pickle to an anydbm file).

Basic procmail usage goes something like this:

:0fw
| spamassassin -P

:0
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
$SPAM

Which just says, "Run spamassassin -P reinjecting its output into the
processing stream. If the resulting mail has a header which begins
"X-Spam-Status: Yes", toss it into the folder indicated by the variable
$SPAM.

SpamAssassin also adds other headers as well, which give you more detail
about how its tests fared. I'd like to see spambayes operate in at least
this way: do its thing then return a message to stdout with a modified set
of headers which further processing downstream can key on.

Do you feel capable of writing such a tool? It doesn't look too hard.

Ultimately I'd like to see tight integration into the "most popular
email clients"..

The advantage of using a kitchen sink (umm, make that highly programmable)
editor+email package like Emacs+VM is that you can twiddle your key bindings
and write a little ELisp (or Pymacs) glue to toss messages in the right
direction (spam or ham). For this, spambayes would have to operate in an
incremental fashion when fed a single ham or spam message.

(No, I have no idea what an "auto-ham" is. A pig run over by a car,
perhaps?)

I personally don't think IMAP has a bright future, but for people who

Writing an IMAP server is a non-trivial task. The specification is huge
and clients do all kinds of weird stuff. POP is very easy in
comparison. Perhaps you could forward messages to a special address or
save them in a special folder to mark them as false negatives.

Alternatively, perhaps there could be a separate protocol and client
that could be used to review additions to the training set. Each day a
few random spam and ham messages could be grabbed as candidates.
Someone would periodically startup the client, review the candidates,
reclassify or remove any messages they don't like and add them to the

I think people will be much more motivated to report spam than ham. I
like the general approach that copies of random messages will be
sequestered for some period of time before they're assumed to be ham.
Matched with a simple spam reporting scheme, this could keep the
training up to date with little effort. I've sketched out an approach
a listserver like Mailman could do along these lines and if I get some
free time I'll hack something together.

I like the idea of a POP proxy which is classifying messages as
they're pulled from the server. The easiest way for such a beast to
be notified of spam might be to simply save the spam in a special
folder or file that the POP proxy would periodically consult.

On Fri, 6 Sep 2002, Guido van Rossum wrote:

Quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm, I'd like to
think about deployment.

Eventually, individuals and postmasters should be able to download a
spambayes software distribution, answer a few configuration questions
about their mail setup, training and false positives, and install it
as a filter.

A more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can
easily be used by individuals (since we're more likely to find
individuals willing to risk this than postmasters).

My impression is that a pre-collected corpus would not fit most individuals
very well, but each individual (or group?) should collect their own corpus.

One problem that comes upp immediately: individuals are lazy.

If I currently get 50 spam and 50 ham a day, and I'll have to
press the 'delete' button once for each spam, I'll be happy
to press the 'spam' button instead. However, if in addition
have to press a 'ham' button for each ham, it starts to look
much less like a win to me. Add the time to install and setup
the whole machinery, and I'll just keep hitting delete.

The suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete
action, that adds a message to the ham corpus. I see two problems
with this: the ham will be a bit skewed; mail that I keep around
without deleting will not be counted. Secondly, if I by force of
habit happen to press the 'delete' key instead of the 'spam' key,
I'll end up with spam in the ham, anyways.

I would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham.

The obvious thing to do is to trigger on the 'spam' button,
and at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one
in the ham corpus, and simply remove them. To do this we
need a way to compare two word count histograms, to see
how similar they are. Any ideas ?

Also, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all.
If they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP),
false positives become the senders problem, to rewrite
to remove the spam smell.

In a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be much
smaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to be
slightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam from
the ham corpus. This should make it easier to keep it clean.

Having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus,
there's less need to worry about it getting there by mistake,
and we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus,
that didn't get deleted by the spam filtering.

It might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from
the spam corpus, in case of user ooops.

/Paul

I guess MUA-level filtering is just a fallback for people who don't have
1) a burning, all-consuming hatred of junk mail, 2) root access to all
mail servers they rely on, and 3) the ability and inclination to install
an MTA with every bell and whistle tweaked to keep out junk mail.

Sure. But for most people, changing their company's or ISP's server
requires years of lobbying, while they have total and immediate
control over their own MUA.

That said, I agree that we should offer a good solution to
postmasters, and I trust that your ideas are right on the mark!

--Guido van Rossum (home page: http://www.python.org/~guido/)
I think one step towards deployment is creating a re-usable tokenizer
for mail messages. The current codebase doesn't expose an easy-to-use
or easy-to-customize tokenizer.

The timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical
knowledge about how to parse mail messages, but the module wasn't
designed for re-use. I'd like to see a module that can take a single
message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one.

I'd like to see the tokenize by customizable, too. Tim had to exclude
some headers from his test data, because there were particular biases
in the test data. If other people have test data without those
biases, they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include
them or exclude others.

Jeremy

[Barry A. Warsaw, gives answers and asks questions]

Here's the code that produced the header tokens:

x2n = {}
for x in msg.keys():
x2n[x] = x2n.get(x, 0) + 1
for x in x2n.items():
yield "header:%s:%d" % x

Some responses:

0.01 19 3559 'header:X-Mailman-Version:1'
0.01 19 3559 'header:List-Id:1'
0.01 19 3557 'header:X-BeenThere:1'

These three are definitely MM artifacts, although the second one
/could/ be inserted by other list management software (it's described
in an RFC).

Since all the ham came from Mailman, and only 19 spam had it, it's quite
safe to assume then that I should ignore these for now.

0.01 0 3093 'header:Newsgroups:1'
0.01 0 3054 'header:Xref:1'
0.01 0 3053 'header:Path:1'

These aren't MM artifacts, but are byproducts of gating a message off
of an nntp feed. Some of the other NNTP-* headers are similar, but I
won't point them out below.

I should ignore these too then.

0.01 19 2668 'header:List-Unsubscribe:1'
0.01 19 2668 'header:List-Subscribe:1'
0.01 19 2668 'header:List-Post:1'
0.01 19 2668 'header:List-Help:1'
0.01 19 2668 'header:List-Archive:1'

RFC recommended generic listserve headers that MM injects.

Ditto.

So why do you get two entries for this one?

0.99 519 0 'header:Received:8'
0.99 466 1 'header:Received:7'

Read the code . The first line counts msgs that had 8 instances of a
'Received' header, and the second counts msgs that had 7 instances. I
expect this is a good clue! The more indirect the mail path, the more of
those thingies we'll see, and if you're posting from a spam trailer park in
Tasmania you may well need to travel thru more machines.

...
Note that header names are case insensitive, so this one's no
different than "MIME-Version:". Similarly other headers in your list.

Ignoring case here may or may not help; that's for experiment to decide.
It's plausible that case is significant, if, e.g., a particular spam mailing
package generates unusual case, or a particular clueless spammer
misconfigures his package.

0.02 65 3559 'header:Precedence:1'

Could be Mailman, or not. This header is supposed to tell other
automated software that this message was automated. E.g. a replybot
should ignore any message with a Precedence: {bulk|junk|list}.

Rule of thumb: if Mailman inserts a thing, I should ignore it. Or, better,
I should stop trying to out-think the flaws in the test data and get better
test data instead!

0.50 4 0 'header:2:1'

!?
...
0.50 0 2 'header:'

Heh?

I sucked out all the wordinfo keys that began with "header:". The last line
there was probably due to unrelated instances of the string "header:" in
message bodies. Harder to guess about the first line.

...
Some headers of course are totally unreliable as to their origin. I'm
thinking stuff like MIME-Version, Content-Type, To, From, etc, etc.
Everyone sticks those in.

The brilliance of Anthony's "just count them" scheme is that it requires no
thought, so can't be fooled . Header lines that are evenly
distributed across spam and ham will turn out to be worthless indicators
(prob near 0.5), so do no harm.

[Anthony Baxter]
The other thing on my todo list (probably tonight's tram ride home) is
to add all headers from non-text parts of multipart messages. If nothing
else, it'll pick up most virus email real quick.

See the checkin comments for timtest.py last night. Adding this code gave a
major reduction in the false negative rate:

def crack_content_xyz(msg):
x = msg.get_type()
if x is not None:
yield 'content-type:' + x.lower()

x = msg.get_param('type')
if x is not None:
yield 'content-type/type:' + x.lower()

for x in msg.get_charsets(None):
if x is not None:
yield 'charset:' + x.lower()

x = msg.get('content-disposition')
if x is not None:
yield 'content-disposition:' + x.lower()

fname = msg.get_filename()
if fname is not None:
for x in fname.lower().split('/'):
for y in x.split('.'):
yield 'filename:' + y

x = msg.get('content-transfer-encoding:')
if x is not None:
yield 'content-transfer-encoding:' + x.lower()

...

t = ''
for x in msg.walk():
for w in crack_content_xyz(x):
yield t + w
t = '>'

I *suspect* most of that stuff didn't make any difference, but I put it all
in as one blob so don't know which parts did and didn't help.

TP> A false positive *really* has to work hard then, eh? The long
TP> quote of a Nigerian scam letter is one of the two that made
TP> it, and spamprob() looked at all this stuff before deciding it
TP> was spam:

Here's an interesting thing to test: discriminate words differently if
they are on a line that starts with `>' or, to catch styles like

Then again, it may not be worth trying to un-false-positive that
Nigerian scam quote.

-Barry
So then, Guido van Rossum is all like:

Basic procmail usage goes something like this:

:0fw
| spamassassin -P

:0
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
$SPAM

Do you feel capable of writing such a tool? It doesn't look too hard.

Not to beat a dead horse, but that's exactly what my spamcan package
did. For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before I
knew about Tim & co's work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from
, but I'm not going
to work on it anymore.

I'm currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest's
booty-kicking tokenizer). I'll probably have something soon, like maybe
half an hour, and no, it's not too hard. The hard part is storing the
data somewhere. I don't want to use ZODB, as I'd like something a
person can just drop in with a default Python install. So anydbm is
looking like my best option.

I already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy's SpamOracle, which
does the same sort of thing. You call it from procmail, it adds a new
header, and then you can filter on that header. Really easy.

Here's how I envision this working. Everybody gets four new mailboxes:

train-eggs
train-spam
trained-eggs
trained-spam

You copy all your spam and eggs* into the "train-" boxes as you get it.
How frequently you do this would be up to you, but you'd get better
results if you did it more often, and you'd be wise to always copy over
anything which was misclassified. Then, every night, the spam fairy
swoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of
things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam. After she's
done, she moves your mail into the "trained-" folders.

This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read
their mail right off the server. I've spoken with some fellows at work
about Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports
appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.

Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail
client to bind the key "S" to "move to train-spam" and "H" to "move to
train-eggs". Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it'd
start showing up in mail clients. That's the "delete as spam" button
Paul Graham was talking about.

* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word "ham" as the
opposite of "spam", and they've been amazingly cool about the use of
their product name for things thus far. So I propose we start calling
non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as
"eggs".

[Jeremy Hylton]
I think one step towards deployment is creating a re-usable tokenizer
for mail messages. The current codebase doesn't expose an easy-to-use
or easy-to-customize tokenizer.

tokenize() couldn't be easier to use: it takes a string argument, and
produces a stream of tokens (whether via explicit list, or generator, or
tuple, or ... doesn't matter). All the tokenize() functions in GBayes.py
and timtest.py are freely interchangeable this way.

Note that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer would
do any good, or, if it would, in which ways customization could be helpful.
That's a research issue on which no work has been done.

The timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical
knowledge about how to parse mail messages, but the module wasn't
designed for re-use.

That's partly a failure of imagination . Splitting out all knowledge
of tokenization is just a large block cut-and-paste ... there, it's done.
Change the

from timtoken import tokenize

at the top to use any other tokenizer now. If you want to make it easier
still, feel free to check in something better.

I'd like to see a module that can take a single message or a collection of
messages and tokenize each one.

The Msg and MsgStream classes in timtest.py are a start at that, but it's
hard to do anything truly *useful* here when people use all sorts of
different physical representations for email msgs (mboxes in various
formats, one file per "folder", one file per msg, Skip's gzipped gimmick,
...). If you're a Python coder , you *should* find it very easy to
change the guts of Msg and MsgStream to handle your peculiar scheme.
Defining interfaces for these guys should be done.

I'd like to see the tokenize by customizable, too. Tim had to exclude
some headers from his test data, because there were particular biases
in the test data. If other people have test data without those
biases, they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include
them or exclude others.

This sounds like a bottomless pit to me, and there's no easier way to
customize than to edit the code. As README.txt still says, though, massive
refactoring would help. Hop to it!

I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all
Python platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.

Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikely
to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even
L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to
their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)

My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a
client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only
going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams
the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The
MUA accesses this "eThunk" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is
retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual
oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)
and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA
fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not
clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.

Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all
MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL's

IMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If
this is available, the "simple viewer" could be enhanced to support viewing
via folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would
use this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best
n-way classifier uses something called a "Support Vector Machine" (SVM)
which is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).

I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves
the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could
be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user's situation.

I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that
leaves the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That
way, it could be dropped into whatever harness that suited the
user's situation.

I see no reason to restrict the project to developing the classifier
and leave the deployment to others. Attempts at deployment in the
real world will surely provide additional feedback for the classifier.

I see no reason why both approaches could and should not be used.
MTA level filtering would just need to use a different corpus, one that
would contain illegal or otherwise commonly unapproved material for the
group of people using that MTA. I'm sure that such an approach would
significantly reduce the mail traffic as a first step, without giving
false positives.

MUA corpus would then be personally trained -- although I'd like the
option of 'down-loadable' corpuses and merge functionality.

5-grams of "long words" containing high-bit characters generates a lot of
database entries, and I suspect they're approximately worthless). OTOH,
adding in more headers will increase the size. So let's call it 10 meg
.

[Guido]
Takers? How is ESR's bogofilter packaged? SpamAssassin? The Perl
Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?

WRT the last, it's a small pile of Windows .exe files along with
cygwin1.dll. The .exes are cmdline programs. One is a POP3 proxy. If I
currently have an email server named, say, mail.comcast.net, with user name
timmy, then I change my email reader to say that my server is 127.0.0.1, and
that my user name on that server is mail.comcast.net:timmy. In that way the
proxy picks up both the real server and user names from what the mail reader
tells it the user name is.

This is an N-way classifier (like ifile that way), and "all it does" is
insert a

X-Text-Classification: one_of_the_class_names_you_picked

header into your email before passing it on to your mail reader. The user
then presumably fiddles their mail reader to look for such headers and "do
something about it" (and even Outlook can handle *that* much ).

The user is responsible for generating text files with appropriate examples
of each class of message, and for running the cmdline tools to train the
classifier.

You missed the part that said that spam is kept in the "eThunk" and was
viewable by a simple viewer for final disposition?

Of course, with Outbloat, you could fire up PythonWin and stuff the spam
into the Junk Email folder... but then you loose the ability to retrain on
the user classified ham/spam.

- A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server. You
configure it by telling it about your real pop servers. You then
point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost. When it
receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads
your mail, and gives you only the non-spam.

FYI, I'll never trust such a scheme: I have no tolerance for false
positives, and indeed do nothing to try to block spam on any of my email
accounts now for that reason. Deliver all suspected spam to a Spam folder
instead and I'd love it.

I don't know how big that pickle would be, maybe loading it each time
is fine. Or maybe marshalling.)

My tests train on about 7,000 msgs, and a binary pickle of the database is
approaching 10 million bytes.

My paltry 3000-message training set makes a 6.3MB (where 1MB=1e6 bytes)
pickle. hammie.py, which I just checked in, will optionally let you
write stuff out to a dbm file. With that same message base, the dbm
file weighs in at a hefty 21.4MB. It also takes longer to write:

Using a database:
real 8m24.741s
user 6m19.410s
sys 1m33.650s

Using a pickle:
real 1m39.824s
user 1m36.400s
sys 0m2.160s

This is on a PIII at 551.257MHz (I don't know what it's *supposed* to
be, 551.257 is what /proc/cpuinfo says).

For comparison, SpamOracle (currently the gold standard in my mind, at
least for speed) on the same data blazes along:

real 0m29.592s
user 0m28.050s
sys 0m1.180s

Its data file, which appears to be a marshalled hash, is 448KB.
However, it's compiled O'Caml and it uses a much simpler tokenizing
algorithm written with a lexical analyzer (ocamllex), so we'll never be
able to outperform it. It's something to keep in mind, though.

I don't have statistics yet for scanning unknown messages. (Actually, I
do, and the database blows the pickle out of the water, but it scores
every word with 0.00, so I'm not sure that's a fair test. ;) In any
case, 21MB per user is probably too large, and 10MB is questionable.

On the other hand, my pickle compressed very well with gzip, shrinking
down to 1.8MB.

[Tim]
My tests train on about 7,000 msgs, and a binary pickle of the database is
approaching 10 million bytes.

That shrinks to under 2 million bytes, though, if I delete all the WordInfo
records with spamprob exactly equal to UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB. Such records
aren't needed when scoring (an unknown word gets a made-up probability of
UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB). Such records are only needed for training; I've noted
before that a scoring-only database can be leaner.

In part the bloat is due to character 5-gram'ing, part due to that the
database is brand new so has never been cleaned via clearjunk(), and part
due to plain evil gremlins.

So then, Tim Peters is all like:

That's pretty good. I wonder how much better you could do by using some
custom pickler. I just checked my little dbm file and found a lot of
what I would call bloat:

import anydbm, hammie
d = hammie.PersistentGrahamBayes("ham.db")
db = anydbm.open("ham.db")
db["neale"], len(db["neale"])
('ccopy_reg\n_reconstructor\nq\x01(cclassifier\nWordInfo\nq\x02c__builtin__\nobject\nq\x03NtRq\x04(GA\xce\xbc{\xfd\x94\xbboK\x00K\x00K\x00G?\xe0\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00tb.', 106)
d.wordinfo["neale"], len(`d.wordinfo["neale"]`)
(WordInfo'(1031337979.16197, 0, 0, 0, 0.5)', 42)

Ignoring the fact that there are too many zeros in there, the pickled
version of that WordInfo object is over twice as large as the string
representation. So we could get a 50% decrease in size just by using
the string representation instead of the pickle, right?

Something about that logic seems wrong to me, but I can't see what it
is. Maybe pickling is good for heterogeneous data types, but every
value of our big dictionary is going to have the same type, so there's a
ton of redundancy. I guess that explains why it compressed so well.

I don't know whether it suggests that, but they would be tagged differently
in to/cc if I were tagging them at all right now. If I were tagging To:
addresses, for example, the tokens would look like

'to:email addr:mit'

instead of

'email addr:mit'

as they appear when an email-like thingie is found in the body. Whether
email addresses should be stuck in as one blob or split up as they are now
is something I haven't tested.

This is the binary pickle of my classifier after training on
my first spam/ham corpora pair. All records with
spamprob == UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB have been purged.

It's in a zip file, and is only half a meg.

Jeremy, it would be interesting if you tried that on your data. The false
negative rates across my other 4 test sets when run against this are:

0.364%
0.400%
0.400%
0.909%

"TP" == Tim Peters writes:

The false positive rate is 0-3%. (Finally! I had to scrub a
bunch of previously unnoticed spam from my inbox.) Both
collections have about 1100 messages.

TP> Does this mean you trained on about 1100 of each?

The total collections are 1100 messages. I trained with 1100/5
messages.

TP> Can't guess. You're in a good position to start adding more
TP> headers into the analysis, though. For example, an easy start
TP> would be to uncomment the header-counting lines in tokenize()
TP> (look for "Anthony"). Likely the most valuable thing it's
TP> missing then is some special parsing and tagging of Received
TP> headers.

I tried the "Anthony" stuff, but it didn't make any appreciable
difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.

Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this "%s: %s" % (hdr, word).
That worked too well :-). The received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.

So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
and x-from_, which all contained timestamps. I also skipped the X-VM-
headers that my mail reader added:

class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):

skip = {'received': 1,
'date': 1,
'x-from_': 1,
}

def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
for k, v in msg.items():
k = k.lower()
if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
continue
for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
for t in tokenize_word(w):
yield "%s:%s" % (k, t)

This did moderately better. The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
tests performed so far. This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
run that used the timtest header tokenizer.

It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
discriminators. There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
Most of the discriminators are header fields. One thing to note is
that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
indicator. That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
spam. The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
XEmacs. That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).

One final note. It looks like many of the false positives are from
people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare. They often
start with stuff like:

Dear Sir/Madam,

May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a
solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly. I am old science student

I guess that reads a lot like spam :-(.

I hacked up something to turn WordInfo into a tuple before pickling,

That's what WordInfo.__getstate__ does.

and then turn the tuple back into WordInfo right after unpickling.

Likewise for WordInfo.__setstate__.

Without this hack, my database was 21549056 bytes. After, it's 9945088
bytes.
That's a 50% savings, not a bad optimization.

I'm not sure what you're doing, but suspect you're storing individual
WordInfo pickles. If so, most of the administrative pickle bloat is due to
that, and doesn't happen if you pickle an entire classifier instance
directly.

So my question is, would it be too painful to ditch WordInfo in favor of
a straight out tuple? (Or list if you'd rather, although making it a
tuple has the nice side-effect of forcing you to play nice with my
DBDict class).

I hope doing this sort of optimization isn't too far distant from the
goal of this project, even though README.txt says it is :)

Diff attached. I'm not comfortable checking this in,

I think it's healthy that you're uncomfortable checking things in with

+ # XXX: kludge kludge kludge.

comments .

since I don't really like how it works (I'd rather just get rid of
WordInfo).
But I guess it proves the point :)

I'm not interested in optimizing anything yet, and get many benefits from
the *ease* of working with utterly vanilla Python instance objects. Lots of
code all over picks these apart for display and analysis purposes. Very few
people have tried this code yet, and there are still many questions about it
(see, e.g., Jeremy's writeup of his disappointing first-time experiences
today). Let's keep it as easy as possible to modify for now. If you're
desparate to save memory, write a subclass?

Other people are free to vote in other directions, of course .

[Barry]
Here's an interesting thing to test: discriminate words differently if
they are on a line that starts with `>' or, to catch styles like
above, that the first occurance on a line of is > (to eliminate
html).

Give me a mod to timtoken.py that does this, and I'll be happy to test it.

Then again, it may not be worth trying to un-false-positive that
Nigerian scam quote.

If there's any sanity in the world, even the original poster would be glad
to have his kneejerk response blocked . OTOH, you know there are a
great many msgs on c.l.py (all over Usenet) that do nothing except quote a
previous post and add a one-line comment. Remove the quoted sections from
those, and there may be no content left to judge except for the headers. So
I can see this nudging the stats in either direction. The only way to find
out for sure is for you to write some code .

[Jeremy Hylton[
The total collections are 1100 messages. I trained with 1100/5
messages.

I'm reading this now as that you trained on about 220 spam and about 220
ham. That's less than 10% of the sizes of the training sets I've been
using. Please try an experiment: train on 550 of each, and test once
against the other 550 of each. Do that a few times making a random split
each time (it won't be long until you discover why directories of individual
files are a lot easier to work -- e.g., random.shuffle() makes this kind of
thing trivial for me).

The second f-p had the same structure (and sender :-); the third f-p
had the same structure and a different sender. Ditto the fifth, sixth. (Not posting clues for
brevity.)

The fourth was different: plaintext with one very short sentence and a
URL. Clues:

The seventh was similar.

I scanned a bunch more until I got bored, and most of them were either
of the first form (brief text with URL followed by quoted HTML from
website) or the second (brief text with one or more URLs).

It's up to you to decide what to call this, but I think these are none
of your #1, #2 or #3 (they're close to #3, but all are multipart/mixed
rather than multipart/alternative).

So I guess I'll have to retrain it (yes, you told me so :-).

That would be a different experiment. I'm certainly curious to see whether
Jeremy's much-worse-than-mine error rates are typical or aberrant.

It's possible that the corpus you've trained on is more homogeneous
than you thought.

--Guido van Rossum (home page: http://www.python.org/~guido/)
I also looked in more detail at some f-p's in my geeks traffic. The
first one's a doozie (that's the term, right? :-). It has lots of
HTML clues that are apparently ignored.

?? The clues below are *loaded* with snippets unique to HTML (like '').

I *meant* to say that they were 0.99 clues cancelled out by 0.01
clues. But that's wrong too! It looks I haven't grokked this part of
your code yet; this one has way more than 16 clues, and it seems the
classifier basically ended up counting way more 0.99 than 0.01 clues,
and no others made it into the list. I thought it was looking for
clues with values in between; apparently it found none that weren't
exactly 0.5?

That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!

This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few
similar ones. I wonder if there's anything we can learn from looking
at the clues and the HTML. It was heavily marked-up HTML, with ads in
the sidebar, but the body text was a serious discussion of "OO and
soft coding" with lots of highly technical words as clues (including
Zope and ZEO).

That there are *any* 0.50 clues in here means the scheme ran out of
anything interesting to look at. Adding in more header lines should
cure that.

Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?
Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make
progress there?

The seventh was similar.

I scanned a bunch more until I got bored, and most of them were either
of the first form (brief text with URL followed by quoted HTML from

If those were text/plain, the HTML tags should have been stripped. I'm
still confused about this part.

No, sorry. These were all of the following structure:

multipart/mixed
text/plain (brief text plus URL(s))
text/html (long HTML copied from website)

I guess you get this when you click on "mail this page" in some
browsers.

That HTML tags aren't getting stripped remains the biggest mystery to me.

Still?

This seems confused: Jeremy didn't use my trained classifier pickle,
he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora.
That's an entirely different kind of experiment from the one you're
trying (indeed, you're the only one so far to report results from
trying my pickle on their own email, and I never expected *that* to
work well; it's a much bigger mystery to me why Jeremy got such
relatively worse results from training his own -- and he's the only
one so far to report results from *that* experiment).

I think it's still corpus size.

There's a brief discussion of this before the definition of
MAX_DISCRIMINATORS. All clues with prob MIN_SPAMPROB and MAX_SPAMPROB are
saved in min and max lists, and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap.
Then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of
clues in the longer list. Whatever remains of the longer list (if anything)
is then fed into the nbest heap too, but no more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS of
them. In no case do more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS clues enter into the final
probability calculation, but all of the min and max lists go into the list
of clues (else you'd have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring;
and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual
review is needed). In your specific case, the excess of clues in the longer
MAX_SPAMPROB list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap, and that's
why you didn't see anything other than 0.01 and 0.99.

Before adding these special lists, the outcome when faced with many 0.01 and
0.99 clues was too often a coin toss: whichever flavor just happened to
appear MAX_DISCRIMINATORS//2 + 1 times first determined the final outcome.

That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!

This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few
similar ones.

I just beat it : a tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores
punctuation, and strips a trailing 's' from words, and saves both word
bigrams and word unigrams, turned up a low-probability very long spam with a
list of 410 0.01 clues and 125 0.99 clues! Yikes.

I wonder if there's anything we can learn from looking at the clues and
the
HTML. It was heavily marked-up HTML, with ads in the sidebar, but the
body
text was a serious discussion of "OO and soft coding" with lots of highly
technical words as clues (including Zope and ZEO).

No matter how often it says Zope, it gets only one 0.01 clue from doing so.
Ditto for ZEO. In contrast, HTML markup has many unique "words" that get
0.99. BTW, this is a clear case where the assumption of
conditionally-independent word probabilities is utterly bogus -- e.g., the
probability that "" appears in a message is highly correlated with the
prob of "" appearing. By treating them as independent, naive Bayes
grossly misjudges the probability that both appear, and the only thing you
get in return is something that can actually be computed .

Read the "What about HTML?" section in tokenizer.py. From the very start,
I've been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at
python.org, and HTML decorations have so far been too strong a clue to
justify ignoring it in that specific context. I haven't done anything
geared toward personal email, including the case of non-mailing-list email
that happens to go through python.org.

I'd prefer to strip HTML tags from everything, but last time I tried that it
still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora (the full test
results with and without HTML tag stripping is included in the "What about
HTML?" comment block). But as the comment block also says,

# XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here
# XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.

and we've since done several things that gave significant f-n rate
reductions. I should test that again now.

Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?

Almost all of them -- apart from MIME decorations that appear in both
headers and bodies (like Content-Type), the *only* header lines the base
tokenizer looks at now are Subject, From, X-Mailer, and Organization.

Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make
progress there?

I would need different data, yes. My ham is too polluted with Mailman
header decorations (which I may or may not be able to clean out, but fudging
the data is a Mortal Sin and I haven't changed a byte so far), and my spam
too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it. In
particular I have to skip To and Received headers now, and I suspect they're
going to be very valuable in real life (for example, I don't even catch
"undisclosed recipients" in the To header now!).

...
No, sorry. These were all of the following structure:

multipart/mixed
text/plain (brief text plus URL(s))
text/html (long HTML copied from website)

Ah! That explains why the HTML tags didn't get stripped. I'd again offer
to add an optional argument to tokenize() so that they'd get stripped here
too, but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like
a loss .

This seems confused: Jeremy didn't use my trained classifier pickle,
he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora.
...

I think it's still corpus size.

I reported on tests I ran with random samples of 220 spams and 220 hams from
my corpus (that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting
on sets of those sizes), and while that did harm the error rates, the error
rates I saw were still much better than Jeremy reported when using 500 of
each.

Ah, a full test run just finished, on the

tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores punctuation, and strips
a
trailing 's' from words, and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams

This is the code:

# Tokenize everything in the body.
lastw = ''
for w in word_re.findall(text):
n = len(w)
# Make sure this range matches in tokenize_word().
if 3 = 3:
lastw = ''
for t in tokenize_word(w):
yield t

where

word_re = re.compile(r"[\w$\-\x80-\xff]+")

This at least doubled the process size over what's done now. It helped the
f-n rate significantly, but probably hurt the f-p rate (the f-p rate is too
low with only 4000 hams per run to be confident about changes of such small
*absolute* magnitude -- 0.025% is a single message in the f-p table):

Last time I tried this (see tokenizer.py comments), the f-n rate after
stripping tags ranged from 0.982% to 1.781%, with a median of about 1.34%,
so we've made tons of progress on the f-n rate since then. But the mere
presence of HTML tags still remains a significant clue for c.l.py traffic,
so I'm left with the same comment:

# XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here
# XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.

If we want to take the focus of this away from c.l.py traffic, I can't say
what effect HTML stripping would have (I don't have suitable test data to
measure that on).

Before we get too far down this road, what do people think of
creating a spambayes package containing classifier and tokenizer?
This is just to minimize clutter in site-packages.

Guido> Too early IMO (if you mean to leave the various other tools out
Guido> of it).

Well, I mentioned classifier and tokenize only because I thought they were
the only importable modules. The rest represent script-level code, right?

Guido> If and when we package this, perhaps we should use Barry's trick
Guido> from the email package for making the package itself the toplevel

That would be perfect. I tried in the naive way last night, but wound up
with all .py files in the package, which wasn't my intent.

If you've still got the summary files, please cvs up and try running cmp.py
again -- in the process of generalizing cmp.py, you managed to make it skip
half the lines . That is, if you've got N sets, you *should* get
N**2-N pairs for each error rate. You have 3 sets, so you should get 6
pairs of f-n rates and 6 pairs of f-p rates.

the title, then the sequel could have been called "The
Derivative Of Distress - With Respect To Terror" for largely
humourless feelgood nuclear thriller THE SUM OF ALL FEARS

pelvic thrusts by a child; drinking with multiple drugging;
"Let's kick their [posteriors]" - which is not included in the
list of three/four letter word vocabulary but is impudent;
toilet humor - smothering in a pile of dung with fecal matter
in mouth)...

CONFECTIONERY THEORY>> "Are you tracking breakfast cereal?"
inquired a concerned LLOYD WOOD, after recently wandering into
the "kiddy end" of the cereal aisle. "They've all gone CD-ROM
on the front", he observed - causing him, for a moment to
think he was looking at "some really bloated computer
magazines". Of course we are, Lloyd, though we're not as
easily swayed by gimmicks as you are, and thus can impartially
report that NESTLE's Maryland-style COOKIE CRISP are the most
biscuit-like breakfast ever, easily triumphing over KELLOGG's
FROSTIES CHOCOLATE (too much chocolate, not enough "frosty"),
COCO POPS CRUNCHERS (clump together in this humid weather) and
even the Winnie The Pooh-themed DISNEY HUNNY B's - and if you
mix them all together, the milk goes so chocolatey it'll turn
your Pooh brown... elsewhere in dairy, MCDONALD'S continue a
disappointing run of toppings for the MCFLURRY (99p) -

Crunch: http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02001-08-10&l=286#l .
Reader ED AVIS complains that KFC don't tell you that their
"M&M" AVALANCHE (also 99p) does not feature real M&Ms but
"special miniaturised ones", which he describes as "frozen
solid" and "might as well be small bits of gravel for all the
chocolate flavour they impart". While, following last week's
announcement of Ice T's Posse Pops, CRAIG LEFF thought we'd be
reassured by the news that NBC are launching their own range
of TV-themed Baskin-Robbins ice-creams, including a "Fear
Factor" flavour designed to recreate the experience of eating
"dirt and spiders": http://www.adage.com/news.cms?newsId=35520
... back with confectionery, LEON VERRALL remained unimpressed
with STARBURST FRUITINESSE (from 49p, "tasted of plastic...
[resembled] those 'food pills' they thought we'd all be eating
by now"), DAVID BLANE grudgingly approved of the TWIX TRIPLE
CHOC LIMITED EDITION ("Not bad, faintly evoking Penguins,
which I never liked because of the thick chocolate"), and the
whole point of that controversial "It's not for girls"
campaign was revealed: to position NESTLE DOUBLE CREAM (40p)
as a more female-friendly version of the YORKIE BAR. Other
treats to look forward to in coming weeks: Cola-flavoured
CADBURY-TREBOR REFRESHERS, chicken-wings-flavoured HULA HOOPS,

OTOH, look into DCC (Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse,
http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/), which uses fuzzy checksums.
It's quite likely that DCC's checksumming scheme is better than
something any of us would throw together for personal use (no offense,
Skip!). But I have no personal experience of it.

[followups to spambayes@python.org please, unless you're specifically
concerned about some particular bit of email policy for python.org]

OK, after much fiddling with and tweaking of /etc/exim/exim4.conf and
/etc/exim/local_scan.py on mail.python.org, I am fairly confident that
I can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment's notice. For the
record, here's how it all works:

* exim4.conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file
/etc/exim/harvest does not exist. That is, any "junk mail
condition" that can be detected by Exim ACLs (access control lists)
is handled entirely in exim4.conf: the message is rejected before it
ever gets to local_scan.py. This covers such diverse cases as
"message from known spammer" (reject after every RCPT TO command),
"no message-id header", and "8-bit chars in subject" (both rejected
after the message headers/body are read).

The main things I have changed in the absence of /etc/exim/harvest
are:
- don't check for 8-bit chars in "From" header -- the vast
majority of hits for this test were bounces from some
Asian ISP; the remaining hits should be handled by SpamAssassin
- do header sender verification (ie. ensure that there's a
verifiable email address in at least one of "From", "Reply-to",
and "Sender") as late as possible, because it requires DNS
lookups which can be slow (and can also make messages that
should have been rejected merely be deferred, if those DNS
lookups timeout)

* if /etc/exim/harvest exists, then the behaviour of all of those
ACLs in exim4.conf suddenly changes: instead of rejecting recipients
or messages, they add an X-reject header to the message. This
header is purely for internal use; it records the name of the folder
to which the rejected message should be saved, and also gives the
SMTP error message which should ultimately be used to reject
the message.

Thus, those messages will now be seen by local_scan.py, which now
looks for the X-reject header. If found, it uses the folder name
specified there to save the message, and then rejects it with the
SMTP error message also given in X-reject. (Currently X-reject is
retained in saved messages.)

If a message was not tagged with X-reject, then local_scan.py
runs the usual virus and spam checks. (Namely, my homebrew
scan for attachments with filenames that look like Windows
executables, and a run through SpamAssassin.) The logic is
basically this:
if virus:
folder = "virus"
else:
run through SpamAssassin
if score >= 10.0:
folder = "rejected-spam"
elif score >= 5.0:
folder = "caught-spam"

Finally, local_scan.py writes the message to the designated folder.
By far the biggest folder will be "accepted" -- the server handles
2000-5000 incoming messages per day, of which maybe 100-500 are junk
mail. (Oops, just realized I haven't written the code that actually
saves the message -- d'ohh! Also haven't written anything to
discriminate personal email, which I must do. Sigh.)

* finally, the big catch: waiting until after you've read the message
headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic,
because certain broken MTAs (including those used by some spammers)
don't consider a 5xx after DATA as a permanent error, but keep
retrying. D'ohh. This is a minor annoyance currently, where a fair
amount of stuff is rejected at RCPT TO time. But in harvest mode,
*everything* (with the exception of people probing for open relays)
will be rejected at DATA time. So I have cooked up something called
the ASBL, or automated sender blacklist. This is just a Berkeley DB
file that maps (sender_ip, sender_address) to an expiry time. When
local_scan() rejects a message from (sender_ip, sender_address) --
for whatever reason, including finding an X-reject header added by
an ACL in exim4.conf -- it adds a record to the ASBL, with an expiry
time 3 hours in the future. Meanwhile, there's an ACL in exim4.conf
that checks for records in the ASBL; if there's a record for the
current (sender_ip, sender_address) that hasn't expired yet, we
reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or
body.

The downside of this from the point-of-view of corpus collection is
that if some jerk is busily spamming *@python.org, one SMTP
connection per address, we will most likely only get one copy. This
is a win if you're just thinking about reducing server load and
bandwidth, but I'm not sure if it's helpful for training spam
detectors. Tim?

Happy harvesting --

As usual for me, this is an aggregate of 20 runs, each both training and
predicting on 4000 c.l.py ham + ~2750 BruceG spam.

Only 25 ham scores out of 80,000 are above 0.025 now (and, yes, the
"Nigerian scam"-quoting msg is still counted as ham -- I haven't taken
anything out of the ham corpus since remving the "If AOL were a car" spam),
the f-p rate wouldn't have changed at all if the spamprob cutoff were
dropped from 0.90 to 0.675, dropping the cutoff to 0.40 would have added
only 2 false positives, and dropping it to 0.15 would have added only
another 2 more!

It's spooky.

up using either hammie or spamassassin to do the initial sort - previously
I've used various forms of 'grep' for keywords and a little gui thing to
pop a message up and let me say 'spam/ham', but that's just getting too, too

I can't make it available en masse, but I will look at finding some of

How many runs is this summarizing? For each, how many ham&spam were in the

The effect of set sizes on accuracy rates isn't known. I've informally
reported some results from just a few controlled experiments on that.
Jeremy reported improved accuracy by doubling the training set size, but
that wasn't a controlled experiment (things besides just training set size
changed between "before" and "after").

Yup, tagging data is mondo tedious, and mistakes hurt.

I expect hammie will do a much better job on this already than hand
grepping. Be sure to stare at the false positives and get the spam out of
there.

'anecdotal' for now) is that the 'skip' tokens end up in a _lot_ of the
f-ps.

With probabilities favoring ham or spam? A skip token is produced in lieu
of "word" more than 12 chars long and without any high-bit characters. It's
possible that they helped me because raw HTML produces lots of these.
However, if you're running current CVS, Tokenizer/retain_pure_html_tags
defaults to False now, so HTML decorations should vanish before body
tokenization.

* Judge Grants Consumer Voice in ReplayTV Lawsuit

Hollywood Tries to Skip Over Consumers' Concerns

Los Angeles - Judge Florence Cooper today granted five ReplayTV owners
a voice in the court debate over their rights to record television
programs and to skip commercials using digital video recorders (DVRs).
The federal court denied the entertainment industry motion to dismiss
the ReplayTV owners' lawsuit and agreed to combine the consumer
lawsuit with an entertainment industry lawsuit filed last fall to ban
ReplayTV DVRs.

"We're pleased the court has recognized that the debate about digital
video recorders must include the customers who purchase and use the
devices," said Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Intellectual
Property Attorney Robin Gross.

"[T]he issue of whether the Newmark Plaintiffs' use of the ReplayTV
DVRs' send-show and commercial-skipping features constitutes fair use
will most likely figure prominently in both the ReplayTV action and
the Newmark action," wrote Judge Cooper in her opinion.

Responding to the entertainment industry's lawsuit against DVR
manufacturers, EFF petitioned the court on behalf of the five ReplayTV
owners to declare legal their use of the digital devices also known as
personal video recorders (PVRs). EFF seeks to ensure that the legal
debate over DVRs will include consumers' concerns along with those of
the entertainment and consumer electronics industries.

The entertainment industry claims that commercial skipping infringes
copyright and digital recording aids piracy.

"I'm not a crook if I skip commercials or share a news interview of
myself with my mom using the SendShow feature rather than sending her
a videotape," said Craig Newmark, founder of craigslist.org and a
ReplayTV owner. "I shouldn't have to worry about getting prosecuted,
but the Turner Broadcasting CEO tells us that taking a bathroom break
is criminal. We even have Senators urging Attorney General Ashcroft to
prosecute people who share files."

Along with Newmark, ReplayTV customers filing the lawsuit with legal
representation by the EFF are: Keith Ogden, owner of a financial
broker firm in San Francisco; Shawn Hughes, a small business owner in
Georgia; Seattle journalist Glenn Fleishman; and southern Californian
video engineer Phil Wright.

* Musician Disputes Industry's Stance on Music Sharing

Janis Ian Urges Artists Speak Out, Support Free Downloads

San Francisco - Grammy-winning songwriter and recording artist Janis
Ian today challenged the music industry by celebrating peer-to-peer
(P2P) music sharing as a boon to musicians.

Ian, who is in the San Francisco Bay Area as part of her current
concert tour, recently published "The Internet Debacle," a pointed
critique of the music industry's disregard for musicians and consumers
who want to distribute and acquire music online. The Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF) applauds Ian's actions and hopes that others
will see the Internet as an aid, not a threat, to musicians.

In the article, Ian assails the major record labels' argument that P2P
file-sharing is harming artists.

"Free Internet downloads are good for the music industry and its
artists," explains Ian. "Every act that can't get signed to a major,
for whatever reason, can reach literally millions of new listeners,
enticing them to buy the CD and come to the concerts."

She adds that during the heyday of Napster she saw a marked increase
in CD sales from her website. She attacks technological and political
measures meant to harm consumers by restricting their right to copy
and back up their legally purchased music.

Ian will play on August 17 in San Rafael, CA.

During her 17 album career, Ian has earned nine Grammy nominations and
three awards. Her best known songs include 1967's "Society's Child"
and 1975's "At Seventeen." More recently, her 1993 album "Breaking
Silence" was nominated for a Grammy Award as Contemporary Folk Album
of the Year. Her songs have been recorded by artists ranging from
Bette Midler to Cher, from Glen Campbell to Vanilla Fudge, and from
Joan Baez to Etta James.

* Court Hearing Set in DeCSS Publication Jurisdiction Case

On September 5, 2002, the California Supreme Court will hear oral
arguments about whether a California court has jurisdiction over
Matthew Pavlovich, an Indiana college student who is a resident of
Texas, for his hosting of an Internet mailing list. Pavlovich
maintained the mailing list for the LiVid programming group, which
provides a unified development and user resource center for video and
DVD-related work for the Linux operating system. One of the group's
projects was to create a DVD player for computer systems that run
Linux. As part of that effort, DeCSS, a program that decrypts the copy
protection on DVDs, was published on the group's mailing list. The
entertainment industry has sued Pavlovich in California court, and
last year a California appellate court ruled Pavlovich was within the
state court's jurisdiction since he published information that relates
to the entertainment industry, which is based in California.

EFF and Pavlovich's legal team argue that Pavlovich is outside of
California's jurisdiction since he was a college student in Indiana
with no contacts to California when DeCSS was published on the LiVid
list. The hearing on September 5 will take place in San Francisco.

Alas, all 4 of the 0.99 clues there are HTML-related.

That begged to try it again but with Tokenize/retain_pure_html_tags false.
The random halves getting trained on and scored against are different here,
and I repaired the bug that dropped 1 ham and 1 spam on the floor, so this
isn't exactly a 1-change difference between runs.

Ham distribution for all runs:
* = 167 items

Spam distribution for all runs:

false positive rate: 0.0100%
false negative rate: 0.3490%

Yay! That may mean that HTML tags aren't really needed in my test data
provided it's trained on enough stuff. Curiously, the sole false positive
here is the same as the sole false positive on the half&half run reported in
the preceding msg (I assume the Nigerian scam "false positive" just happened
to end up in the training data both times):

There are still two HTML clues remaining there (" " and
"content-type:text/html"). Anthony's trick accounts for almost a third of
these. "Python" appears in 5 of them ('http0:python' means that 'python'
was found in the 1st field of an embedded http:// URL). Sticking a .gif or
a .jpg in a URL both score as 0.99 spam clues. Note the damning pattern of
capitalization in 'header:MiME-Version:1'! This counting is case-sensitive,
and nobody ever would have guessed that MiME is more damning than SUBJECT or
DATE. Why would spam be likely to end up with two instances of Return-Path
in the headers?

I've been running hammie on all my incoming messages, and I noticed that
multipart/alternative messages are totally hosed: they have no content,
just the MIME boundaries. For instance, the following message:

------------------------------8
To: neale@woozle.org
Subject: Booga
Content-type: multipart/alternative; boundary="snot"

This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

--snot
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

Hi there.
--snot
Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

------------------------------8
To: neale@woozle.org

This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

Hmmm. How about you create empty Data/Ham/Set[12345], stuff all your
files into a Data/Ham/reservoir folder, then run the rebal.py script to
randomly parcel messages out to the various real directories?

I suspect you can pull the same stunt for your Data/Spam stuff.

I'm afraid rebal is quadratic-time in the # of msgs it shuffles around --
since it was only intended to move a few files around, it's dead simple.

An easy thing is to start the same way: move all the files into a single
directory. Then do random.shuffle() on an os.listdir() of that directory.
Then it's trivial to split the result into N slices, and move the files into
N other directories accordingly.

I suspect you can pull the same stunt for your Data/Spam stuff.

Yup!

They weren't partitioned in any particular scheme - I think I'll write a

The latest proposal to drive the Taliban and Al Qaeda out of the
Mountains of Afghanistan is to send in the ASF (Alabama Special
Forces) Billy Bob, Bubba, Boo, Scooter, Cooter and Junior are being
sent in with the following information about the Taliban:

1. There is no limit.
2. The season opened last weekend.
3. They taste just like chicken.
4. They hate beer, pickup trucks, country music, and Jesus.
5. Some are queer.
6. They don't like barbecue.

And most importantly...

7. They were responsible for Dale Earnhardt's death.

We estimate it should be over in just about two days.

A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt.

The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding. The
card said nothing but "Maxwell House". Mom was puzzled at first, but
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: "Good till
the last drop." Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter.

The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding,
and the card read: "Benson & Hedges". Mom now knew to go straight to
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack:
"Extra Long, King Size". She was again slightly embarrassed but still
happy for her daughter.

The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean. Mom waited for
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing. Then after a
whole month, a card finally arrived. Written on it with shaky
handwriting were the words: "British Airways". Mom took out her latest
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst,
and finally found the ad for the airline. The ad said: "Three times a
day, seven days a week, both ways."

Mom fainted.

Brothel duty for Australian MP

A conservative Member of Parliament in Australia is set to
spend the day as a "slave" at one of Western Australia's most
notorious brothels.

Liberal Party member Barry Haase was "won" in a charity auction
after the madam of Langtree's brothel in the mining town of
Kalgoorlie made the highest offer for his services for a day.

[...]

"I hope he will leave with an informed decision on what
Australian brothels are all about and it will help him in his
political career to make informed decisions that he might not
have been able to make before," Ms Kenworthy said.

Mr Haase, a member of Prime Minister John Howard's party
seemed relaxed about the prospect of working in a brothel.

"You can't be half-hearted about fundraising for significant
charities and I think I'm big enough to play the game," he said.

They seem to have quite a few crashes when the
system seem to
be allocating
a pointer and then jumping off into the oblivion.
I'd say we
should get
them watch.pl to see if they're running out of
memory. The
crashes are all
over the map but all of them seem to relate
back to being
unable to trying
to get memory or to having an invalid pointer
of some sort.

"Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift
f> whole societies out of poverty" I'm not a
f> socio-political/history buff - does anybody have some clear
f> examples?

China? Ooops, no wait, scratch that.

There is one counter example that I can think of, but it may not be
precisely "free trade/markets" -- when Ben Franklin first visited
England he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous. Ben
explained that they used "Colonial Script", a kind of barter-dollar,
and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment. The
British bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to
clamp down on the practice. Within a few years, the colonies were
rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire.

According to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political
party here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about
tea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were
protesting. If this is true, then it comes right back to the forces
that killed Ned Ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believes
they were protesting a tea tax. The same pamphlet claimed that Canada
was also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in the
late-50's or early 60's, the right to print money was removed from the
juristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada.

I've wondered about all this. Certainly the timeline of the collapse
of the Canadian economy fits the profile, but there are oodles of
other causes (for example, spending money like we had 300M people when
we only had 20M) Anyone have any further information on this?

Also, the lifestyle of the remnants of those
societies is on average only marginally above poverty even today.

As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans
who speak english at home and those who do not. I don't have figures
that separate those at hand, though.

1989 American Indians (US Pop as a whole) -- Families below poverty
27.2% (10%), Persons below poverty 31.2 (13.1), Speak a language other
than English 23 (13.8) Married couple families 65.8 (79.5) Median family
income $21,619 ($35,225) Per Capita $8,284 ($14,420).

Note: High Income countries in 1989 were defined as having over $6,000
per capita. American Indians separated from the rest of the US society
would still be considered a high-income society.

Clearly, it is US/NATO = Sun/IBM/OSS, USSR = MS

Most of them seem to have Ivy League educations, or are Ivy League
dropouts suggesting to me that they weren't exactly poor to start
with.

Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
"Bootstraps", boys and girls? I knew you could...

[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run "high" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]

The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
"terminal" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.

Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.

Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and "biased" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.

The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with "terminal"
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.

BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a "terminal" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.

[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]

BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that "new" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not "stolen" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.

That efficiency is called "progress", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...

In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor "theory" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.

To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

RAH

I love this business. If a bridge falls over, the architect or the
engineer is in court the next day, but when a /software/ bridge falls
over, we blame the air beneath it, or the phase of the moon, or
(more often) the people walking on it.

"What idiots! Don't they know you're supposed to walk on the

structural supports! Geez. Pedestrians are /so/ stupid."

Ours is the /only/ industry that can hold itself 100% un-responsible
for any and all sloth-inflicted doom, and the only industry which can
/also/ get away with feeding this myth of infallibility unquestioned
to the media, to investors, to students and to each other.

"God I hate telephones. Telephones are stupid. I used a telephone
to, like, call my broker yesterday, and y'know, just /after/ I'd

You just gotta love a mass-delusion like that.

Although it's like a total shock to 99.999% (5nines) of all the
employed website designers out there, the truth is webforms /can/
accept "U.S. of A" as a country. Incredible, but true. Web forms can
also accept /multiple/ or even /free-form/ telephone numbers and can
even be partitioned into manageable steps. All this can also be done
without selling exclusive rights to your wallet to the World's
Second-Richest Corporation (assuming Cisco is still #1) and vendor
locking your business into their "small transaction fee" tithe.

Of course, try and tell one of those 5-niners that and they'll get all
defensive, black list you as a sh*t disturber and undermine your
reputation with the boss... not that I'm speaking first-hand or
anything ;)

Yes, but this is what normally happened:

Engineer: we can put an input validator/parser on the backend to do
that.

Designer: there's a JavaScript library that can do some of the
pre-validation.

Creative Director: I want it in blue, with a zooming logo.

Engineer: can we get to that later, we need to meet functional specs.

Creative Director: You *don't* understand. *I* want it in blue.

Creative Director: Oh, and the site launches this Friday because I sent
out a press release about our new strategic partnership with HypeCorp.

Designer: fine, we'll just put a list of countries in a drop down.

Engineer: and we can validate against that list.

Creative Director: I don't give a shit. As long as it's in blue. And
has a link to my press release.

Opera 6 has an interesting way around this. You just right-click on each

Dear flatware,

I'm about to undertake a massive project to index/catalog well over one
thousand CDs that have been ripped to MP3 and set up a server to stream
them to different rooms in the house. (Yes, I own them all, no I'm not
broadcasting them to the 'net.) Can anyone give me some recommendations
as to what (free? opensource?) software is best suited for this task? I
know there are a few FoRKs out there who have tackled this problem before...

I'd like to be able to dynamically generate play lists from queries like
"Jazz released between 1950 and 1960" or "Artist such and such between
these dates" or "Just these artists" or "Just this genre" - you get the
idea. In addition to having multiple streams that I can tune in to (a la
DMX), I'd like to be able to browse the database through a web interface
from other computers in the house and pull specific music down to
wherever I am.

Thanks,
Elias

Ah, but you've just gotten to the crux of the
situation. There's good design and bad design.
There's good testing and bad testing. The problem
is, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobody
does. I think "best practices" hasn't caught up
on main street Web enablement yet. There's some
really great packages on how to do this stuff and
in fact the usability people knew that Web forms needed
to be fixed 5 years ago, so that's why we got XForms
and XHTML. You can shoot yourself in the foot and
people usually do. What the problem is, they don't
even recognize that they're gimpy--ever. They just
keeping trundling along making a mess of everything
assured in their job security that they can build
Web forms without even caring if they can be
used or not beyond their test machine.

If you had a piece of software and a security warning
came out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software?
Wouldn't you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally
broken 4 years and 11 months ago? What I want to know
is why would someone use Web forms best practices from
5 years ago? I mean you can get a college degree in that
time. Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows
or Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window
manager? Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for
a brief period of time, but they are completely useless
except for some terminal based replacement applications.

The bottom line is, if you can't get across the
bridge, then it's broken regardless of whose fault
it really is, and it's the business that
needs to take responsibility as they are the ones that
wanted to put the bridge there in the first place.

Vast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be Sealed

September 30, 2002
By JAMES GLANZ and ERIC LIPTON

What is almost certainly the most sophisticated and
complete understanding of exactly how and why the twin
towers of the World Trade Center fell has been compiled as
part of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in
Lower Manhattan.

Amassed during the initial stages of a complicated
insurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the
confidential material contains data and expert analysis
developed by some of the nation's most respected
engineering minds. It includes computer calculations that
have produced a series of three-dimensional images of the
crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,
helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to
the collapses.

An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the
debris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been
accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what
government analysts have been able to put together as they
struggle to answer the scientifically complex and
emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly
failures of the buildings.

But everyone from structural engineers to relatives of
victims fear that the closely held information, which
includes the analysis and the possible answers that
families and engineers around the world have craved, may
remain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed.

Bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the
experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they
wait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are
typical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it
now stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that
certain material can remain secret for the time being - has
approved standard legal arrangements that, should the
lawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial
material generated by the competing sides to be withheld.

"We're obviously in favor of releasing the information, but
we can't until we're told what to do," said Matthys Levy,
an engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,
who is a consultant in the case and the author of "Why
Buildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail" (Norton, 2nd
edition, 2002).

"Let's just say we understand the mechanics of the whole
process" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said.

Monica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the
south tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper
Safety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed.
"If they have answers and are not going to share them, I
would be devastated," Mrs. Gabrielle said. "They have a
moral obligation."

The lawsuit that has generated the information involves
Larry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the
trade center property, and a consortium of insurance
companies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner
that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist
attack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half
that amount, as the insurance companies say.

As both sides have prepared their arguments, they have
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert
opinion about exactly what happened to the towers.

Dean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of
Hartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said
of the findings, "There are some confidentiality agreements
that are keeping those out of the public domain today." He
conceded that differing opinions among the more than 20
insurers on his side of the case could complicate any
release of the material.

As for his own company, whose consultants alone have
produced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of
diagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt
would be made to give the material eventually to "public
authorities and investigative teams."

Still, some of that analysis relies on information like
blueprints and building records from other sources, like
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built
and owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in
the suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the
differing origins of the material would influence his
company's ability to release information.

In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents
would be "decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with
applicable law and policy," adding that it would cooperate
with "federal investigations."

The fate of the research is particularly critical to
resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,
given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into
the buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few
resources, a lack of access to crucial information like
building plans, and infighting among experts and officials.
A new federal investigation intended to remedy those
failings has just begun at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has
studied many building disasters.

Officials with NIST have said it could take years to make
final determinations and recommendations for other
buildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded
up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on
the lawsuit.

Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of
the real estate executive's own heavily financed
investigative work, "We decline to comment other than to
say that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST
investigation." A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was
in discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but
said no transfer had taken place.

With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by
both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body
of science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the
trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well.

"The work should be available to other investigators," said
Ramon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner
at Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier
inquiry. "It could be used to build better buildings in the
future."

Legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one
governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,
from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such
information. In some cases, litigants who paid for the
reports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to
have them sealed forever.
"It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep
some of those documents secret for one reason or another,
some legitimate, some not," said Lee Levine, a First
Amendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington.

Mr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the
information, the court might look favorably on requests to
make it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the
material is unnerving to many people, especially experts
who believe that only a complete review of the evidence -
not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect
their own interests - could lead to an advance in the
federal investigation of the trade center.

"It's important for this to get presented and published and
subjected to some scrutiny," said Dr. John Osteraas,
director of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure
Analysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the
case, "because then the general engineering community can
sort it out."

The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by
any measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger
Associates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called
upon powerful computer programs, originally developed with
the Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of
the Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end.

The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of
the severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged
core of the towers, beginning with the impacts and
proceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -
which Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped
pinpoint the structural failures.

The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer
modeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to
the trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks
immediately after the attacks. But no such constraints
hampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to
the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of
Sept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a
consultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he
had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground
zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how
the towers fell.

Though the FEMA team could not determine "where things
actually fell," Mr. Cuoco said, "we've indicated the
specific locations."

Mr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details
of the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details
of computer calculations his company has done on the spread
of fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.
Osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of
photographs and videos of the towers that day, some of
which he believes have not been available to other
investigators.

And the investigation has not limited itself to computers
and documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind
tunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining
the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed
the weakening structures.

Jack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort
Collins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but
had previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the
original design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. For
the legal case, Dr. Cermak said, "we've done probably more
detailed measurements than in the original design."

"The data that have been acquired are very valuable in
themselves for understanding how wind and buildings
interact," Dr. Cermak said. "Some of the information may be
valuable for the litigation," he said, adding, "I think
I've told you all I can."

What does that exactly have to do with the statement that

Oh thats right Greg. Because was explicitly clear that the pro-Bush
folks went out and did the permit dance. So where in the article is
this again?

Lets get something straight here. This -is- a First Amendment issue.
Public streets, provided one isn't blocking traffic, generally tend to
be sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few
years ago (I'll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have
changed, and the specific facts in this case are weak). IF this guy
_was_ merely holding a sign (which it seems was the case for all the
pro-bush folks) he did nothing wrong. He certainly didn't do enough
of a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge.

I'll play with your perspective though. Lets assume a few things.
If I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably
assemble against Bush, do you think they'll give me a permit?
Probably not. So I lie. Then the cop does what happened in this
scenario. HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I
falsified my statement to get this said document. He arrests me.
End of story.

I'll agree with Owen on this one. Muddied my ass. How hard is it to

down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a
span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the

question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in
general, you're aiding terrorism. If you challenge the beliefs of
the folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you're an
anarchist, and you're herded off to a 'designated protest spot' miles
away from anything. Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.
I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats

over the political figures because they cannot be heard in any other
way.

Getting back to my original point. How do you communicate an idea to
an unknown audience, if you're miles from where the audience is? How
do you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audience
without violating the rules of the regime? I don't think Mr. Nell was
throwing pies at Bush. A sign, the last time I checked, didn't cause
physical injury, or even emotional harm. If I remember Cohen v.
California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), its not the individual speaking that
has the requirement to desist, but the individual listening who has
the option to leave.

Just my .02, while its still considered legal.

In my experience, this protest behavior is really only an issue in
"ultra-liberal" coastal cities, which is where I normally live. It is
part of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable.

For comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably more
serious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain
West. They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable
protest practice. Those protests remain largely civil and polite, if
heated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of the
local population. And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests
I've seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually
facing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are
protesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets
results. Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses
and restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known
to be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very
effective at forcing dialog. I don't recall anyone characterizing their
protests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose.

The right to speak is not the same as the right to be heard by the audience
of the speakers choice.

Disruptive protests might be a means to create awareness - but that's a
pretty lame way to do it. If it truly is the only way, then I'm all for it,
but disruption for the sake of showing how committed the protesters are is
pretty weak.

... webforms /can/
accept "U.S. of A" as a country. Incredible, but true. Web forms can

Are the people who use procrustean web

accept faxes?

When I *really* need to get something
done, instead of just idle surfing, I
call or fax. Faxing, like a web form,
can be done 24x7; it allows me to give
all the (and only the) pertinent info

self-journalled correspondence, which
means rollback is easy and replay is
even easier.

that having a window manager manage the

Huh? Are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard?
Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If
shouting down public speakers is 'protected' it is only a matter of time
before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against
them -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and
non-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos. The tactic
is just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos.
And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society
should be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not

No offense or anything, but there's a difference between holding a
sign that doesn't agree with Bush and screaming at him.

My sole point, as far as the 1st Amendment goes is that there is more
to this game than just being an angry, liberal youth. (Which is the
gross culmination of everyone's argument sofar) The screaming isn't
the most effective method around. I don't believe I argued that it
was. But screaming is happening because the means to communicate to
the representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as the
people doing the screaming are concerned. For the record, I don't
support the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin
Powell shout-down that was mentioned earlier). I don't think that
this is what the 1st Amendment was implying. These folks -do- have a
right to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by the
folks they elected in the first place.

My point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases
such as Mr. Nell. He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts
we have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion. He
has a right to possess this opinion and make it known to the
representatives that are elected. A sign is not a shout-out.

I think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original
thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming
dissenters to the mix. I was mostly responding with my miffedness in
having broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the
policy reasons that might have contributed to it. IN this case, the
screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from
the folks they need to speak with. They're resorting to creative,
offensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply
due to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum. The 'My
generation never did this ' is all BS. THere's more to this story,
we just dont' know it all.

I hope this clarifies my position. For the quick rehash:

Screaming != Free speech on all cases.
Dissent = Free speech, provided you follow what has been laid down by
the Supremes.

M09. Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.
DINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on
their hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in
Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked
together and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid
derivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.
The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities
with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a
description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see
them. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but
not the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth
even if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a
renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.
The definitive work on dragons is "The Flight of Dragons" by Peter
Dickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long
bow. Targets do not come much bigger.

Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer's current scenario is that
there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard
their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They
survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.
They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet
(for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves
but otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.

Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the
dinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also
to appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote
viewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are
contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be
encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and
mind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help
so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great
difficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people's dinosaurs should remove
all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of
Satanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus
if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of
all other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their
psi.

THE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to
hold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.

Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of
rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young
hatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made
them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to
keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this
they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an
act of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the
ability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and
so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have
become the source of all Satans, devils and demons.

Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep
them warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and
only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend
to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is
primarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not
suitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.
Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,
even if they are standing on ice.

Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act
of love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female
can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird
sitting on a nest.

Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,
while birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate
all enemies of their young, but this is secondary.

If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then
purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our
religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,
regardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to
concentrate on "How to Brainwash your Neighbour". Conscious thought has
built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using
"How to care for and protect one's young" as a foundation.

Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something "A load of
dinosaur's eggs". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity
tends to purge all malice back to its roots.

It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,
aided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on
vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the
serenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.

ITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take
control or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. Check for the
following.

Nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.
Eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing
hormones, abilities, etc.
Mind machines.
The original engraving or engram.
GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T
hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the
first job holders.
TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of
time.

My, our, Man's timetracks, etc.
The time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic
Subconscious, etc.
EXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.
Their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever
one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the
higher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or
other basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.
Every extinct race, etc.
BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via
genetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.
Every blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.

a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyright

others.

....

To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internet
bookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that will
bring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,
before arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,
libraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free
high-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are
already in the public domain.

I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and
saw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a
small satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding
machine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a
copy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total
fixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA
had the equipment donated) is under $10k.

One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if
they wished, add these "virtual holdings" (public domain materials) to their
existing library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be
compelling to small libraries in remote areas.

I'm not sure since I haven't attended civics class

The first two are wrong. The first amendment DOES
protect speech the Supreme Court decides it protects
(duh!), and that happens to include most of what
people consider hate speech. Unlike many other
nations, the US has no laws against hate speech, per
se. And the first amendment is the reason for that.

This was poking fun of the practice of making
up differnt types of speech with different
types of protected status. I think the
laws specialing out hate and protected speech
are ridiculous. The point I keep trying to make
is that there's only two types, speech and action.
I agree, they are all speech and should be
covered by the First Amendment, but

If hate speech is so protected, why are certain
states trying to prosecute people for it? There's
only two answers and one of them is wrong.

1) Because hate speech is different and needs to
have a different level of protection dictated
by whoever's offended at the time.
2) It's because it's not just speech, but action.
A action who's consequences are foreseeable by
any reasonable person.

Hate speech is mislabeled. It's really "threat". I think
they let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantage
in being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and
money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY
don't like.

Direct line of sight (no trees, no nothing) can give you ~10 km with
well
aligned directional aerials (and, say, no sleet, no locusts, nor rain
of
blood). If you want to fan out afterwards, use a bridge of a
directional

In this 600 sq ft pre-war New York apartment it goes through 2 or 3

Inside the apartment, it works just fine.

I just did some further testing - through 2 brick walls the range is
about 25 feet. The signal also goes through the roof pretty much
unimpeded.

That said, the Symbol device doesn't have an antenna to speak of, and
I
havent done any tweaking to try to extend the range.

The Linksys unit has two antenna mounts - you could leave one as an
omni
antenna while hooking up a directional antenna to the other.

You might find that you have to use several access points and/or
repeaters to get the coverage you want.

Uh, WWII Enigma was cracked at Bletchly Park, based on the work of some
Poles, who had been trying to figure out when they would be invaded.
Entirely mechanical! Definitely not optical at all. Enigma was
originally broken based on bad use practice. If it had been employed more
sensibly it would have been a lot harder.

See "The Code Book" by Singh, Doubleday, 1999. Or, for that matter,
"Cryptonomicon" by Stephenson, which is a fictionalization of the Enigma
cracking story, and pretty accurate.

I eventually get born as a side-effect of the Battle of Britain, you
see....

Computing with interference patterns, etc, makes perfect sense, but Enigma
was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially Enigma
machines and brute-forcing.

That's what the manual said - a diversity antenna.

Why wouldn't it work well with one omni and one directional antena?

pringles can and the other hooked up to a regular rubber duck.

Direct line of sight (no trees, no nothing) can give you ~10 km with
well

The Linksys unit has two antenna mounts - you could leave one as an

antenna while hooking up a directional antenna to the other.

You might find that you have to use several access points and/or
repeaters to get the coverage you want.

Incredibly creative, in my opinion. Not terribly violent (I mean, how

Its nice to see folks are finding some creative means to make a point.
Even if you don't -agree- with it, its a hard sell to say that this

"Computers are useless. They can only give you answers." (Picasso)

How is this any different from attaching an Infobot or A.L.I.C.E
through licq's console-hook? People have been doing that for years,
and for over a decade in IRC and the MUDs.

... and the one thing I think we've learned in all that time is that,
as a help-desk, it doesn't work. People just don't like talking to
robots, especially when the robots, once confused, become imbeciles.
I think the humans may feel cheated, deceived and tricked when they
discover, as with the Seattle answer, that they are talking to a
machine; there's no real intelligence behind that simulated-friendly
and therefore empty 'thx'.

AIML is clever and cute, but for /practical/ applications as a first
line of technical support? It's been tried over and over, and while I
/also/ think that it /should/ work, for the most part, people won't
use it. What's worse, as we make the NL processing more and more
clever, it only means it fails more dramatically; ALICE doesn't just
stumble a bit, it starts to drool. And ALICE is the best we have.

Like a Dalek: All very impressive when things are going well, but all
it takes to betray the chicken-brain inside is a towel over it's
ill-placed eye, or a spin off the metal surface ;)

In all the prolog-based NL database query systems of the 1980's and
other later chatterbot helpdesk projects like Shallow Red, even
simpler tries like Ask Jeeves, people very quickly know they're
talking to a robot, and the queries anneal to short, truncated and
terse database-like verb-noun or just noun-keyword requests.

People are just too quick to adapt, and too impatient to forgive a
clunky interface, and for now, especially when the /average/ computer
user still can't type more than maybe 5-10wpm, NL is a painfully slow
clunky interface.

Put it this way: Would you login, wake the bot and ask for the Seattle
weather, or would you do as we /all/ do and just click the weather
icon sitting there on your desktop?

Just for fun, here's an interesting conversation between Shallow Red,
ALICE and Eliza as they decide to play the Turing Game:

Gimme a break. This is remarkable for its lack of

1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and

You can read about it in the standard accounts, e.g.

2) For decades before that, codebreakers were using optical
computing in the form of superposed masks to find patterns.
You can read about it in Kahn.

3) People have been doing opto-electronic computing for
decades. There's a lot more to it than just holography.
I get 14,000 hits from
http://www.google.com/search?q=optical-computing

Optical info is a complex-valued wave (spatial frequency, amplitude and
phase)

It isn't right to make it sound like three numbers (frequency,
amplitude, and phase); actually there are innumerable
frequencies, each of which has its own amplitude and phase.

lenses, refractions, and interference are the computational operators.
(add, copy, multiply, fft, correlation, convolution) of 1D and 2D arrays

and, of course, massively parallel by default.

and, of course, allows free-space interconnects.

Some things that are hard with wires are easy with
light-waves. But most things that are easy with wires
are hard with light-waves.

Here's a commercialized effort from israel: a "space integrating
vector-matric multiplier" [ A ] B = [ C ]
laser-> 512-gate modulator -> spread over 2D
"256 Teraflop equivalent" for one multiply per nanosecond.

People were doing smaller versions of that in
the 1980s.

Unclassified example: acousto-optic spectrometer, 500 Gflops equivalent
(for 12 watts!) doing continuous FFTs. Launched in 1998 on a 2-year
mission. Submillimeter wave observatory.

Not "FFTs". FTs. Fourier Transforms. All you need for
taking a D=2 Fourier Transform is a lens. It's undergrad
physics-lab stuff. I get 6,000 hits from:
http://www.google.com/search?q=fourier-optics

Of course, the rest of the talk is about the promise of moving from
optoelectronic to all-optical processors (on all-optical nets & with
optical encryption, & so on).

All optical??? No optoelectronics anywhere???
That's medicinal-grade pure snake oil, USP.

Photons are well known for not interacting with
each other. It's hard to do computing without

mention what the forecast says - without directly being asked.

802.11b - 11Mbps per channel over three channels in the 2.4GHz range
(also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.
802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five
times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft).
8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for
more reliable data transmission.
Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming
video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be
comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much
interference or too many clients.
Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large
area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you
want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a
directional antenna either way.

Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on
802.11... Also, some of the best info on 802.11 security I've seen can
be found at http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/.

"the first computer to crack enigma was optical"

Computing with interference patterns, etc, makes perfect sense, but Enigma
was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially Enigma
machines and brute-forcing.

Look for "Zygalski sheets".

By Koerner's* narrative, it wound up
being a hybrid affair: Bletchley had
mock Enigmas which cycled through the
Enigma's ~18k starting positions in a
quarter of an hour, but the Germans
started using a plugboard which then
had ~1.5x10^14 possibilities. The
Poles noticed that there were some
patterns in the messages which were
only possible via certain plugboard
settings, and so:

When we have collected several such cards corresponding to different
initial signals ..., we place them in a pile so that the squares
corresponding to the same daily settings are aligned and shine a
light beneath the pile. Only those squares which let the light
through will correspond to possible daily settings.

So the brute force hardware allowed
precalculation of "optical" computing
devices which then narrowed down the
possibilities enough for brute force
to again be used for daily decodes,
until:

On 10 May, the Germans invaded France and, on the same day, in
accordance with the best cryptographic principles, they changed their
Enigma procedures in such a way that the 1560 Zygalski sheets, each
with their carefully drilled 1000 or so holes, became just so much
waste cardboard.

-Dave

::::::

"the first synthetic-aperture-radar processor was optical"

This is also easy to believe, given Dr.
Elachi's description of the 1981 Shuttle
Imaging Radar:

The received signal is recorded on an optical film which is retrieved
after landing. The film ... is then processed in an optical correlator
to generate the final image.

which makes sense, as one wishes to shift
each component of the return in proportion
to its frequency, for which one presumably
needs a glorified prism.

Alternatively, the ... signal can be digitized and then recorded on
board or transmitted to the ground via a digital data link. This was
the case with the ... sensor flown in 1984.

::::::

* Koerner, _The Pleasures of Counting_,
in which various aspects of the Enigma
decoding cover four chapters, of which
I quote from two sections of one:
14.2: Beautiful Polish females, and
14.3: Passing the torch
Churchill's romantic soul loved the excitement and secrecy surrounding
Bletchley. He relished the way that
[t]he old procedures, like the setting up of agents, the suborning
of informants, the sending of messages written in invisible ink,
the masquerading, the dressing-up, the secret transmitters, and the
examining of the contents of waste-paper baskets, all turned out
to be largely cover for this other source, as one might keep some
old-established business in rare books going in order to be able,
under cover of it, to do a thriving trade in pornography and erotica
...
Looking at the disparate, unkempt and definitely unmilitary crew
formed by his top code-breakers, he is said to have added to his head
of Intelligence "I know I told you to leave no stone unturned to find

But Colossus was not for Enigma. The bombes used for Enigma were
electro-mechanical. I'm not aware of any application of optical techniques
to Enigma, unless they were done in the US and are still classified. And
clearly, the first bulk breaks of Enigma were done by the bombes, so I
guess it depends whether you count bombes as computers or not, whether this
statement has any credibility at all.

Well I dont have to worry about microwavers in the house. Ours died a week
or so ago and due to doing some research we will nto be getting anysuch
device in the near or far future. I mean even if one half of the crap it
is reported to do is true it s just not worth it for a quick cup or warm
chai.

Which brings me to the fact that finding a good Convection only (not combo
with a microwaver) oven of any good size is dang near impossible unless
you go up to the bizness sizes. thankfully there is Dehlongi of which
costco has thru thier online store.

Now of course the question is do we get it delivered to the old house or
the new one (yep we got our offer approved and are in the short run down
to a long mortage:) we close on oct 31. though the realestate agent says
t happens like that a lot, I still find it incrediably jolting to have
found a house inthe hood I want with the space dawn wants on sunday and we
are signing papers on tuesday night with a close at the end of the month.

Which of course means....wifi land for wsmf:)- )

So far I like the Linksys dsl/cable router all in one wifi ap. The Dlink
has the funky 22mb stuff IF you use all thier stuff across the net and the
way things go I cant say thats gonna happen for sure. Pluse the Linksys
stuff is all over the mass market sotres so I cna walk home with parts at
any time.

The fun now comes with a realization that with ATTbi cable as my main hose
tot he net offering up bwf might be a tad problematic....So i am thinking
of ways around/through/under that. the setup of the particualrs are far
form set in stone...any ideas would be welcome.

Over on Arstechnica (www.arstechnica.com) I saw mention of a Wired article
that goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love and
respect for its users.

http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.html

There is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at
http://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html

"True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gain
a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in
their applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse
engineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular
that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third
party or otherwise) was in development.

All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the
private APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have
updated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have
resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first
place.

But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly
exclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.
But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of
"known" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it
is not allowed to load.

It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants
"developers, developers, developers!", but Microsoft clearly understands
something that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform
vendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. In
Apple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards to
make every single system service and UI element "pluggable" via public
APIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the
number one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if
third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the
desired functionality to be added in "unsupported" ways, then they must be
prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.

But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer
effort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to
provide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish. "

Excellent evidence of the herd. Just imagine if the anonymous noise injected into our world newsphere (noosphere?) was, say, a fraudulent story that a stock accounting scandal had been accused and the evildoers were shorting.

Oh, wait, that happened. An unemployed Orange County student took down Emulex...

Stop Those Presses! Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All

October 2, 2002
By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

Apparently it fell into the category "too good to check."

Last Friday, several British newspapers reported that the
World Health Organization had found in a study that blonds
would become extinct within 200 years, because blondness
was caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The
reports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News
program "Good Morning America," and on Saturday by CNN.

There was only one problem, the health organization said in
a statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds
would become extinct, and it had never done a study on the
subject.

"W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports
originated," said the organization, an agency of the United
Nations based in Geneva, "but would like to stress that we
have no opinion of the future existence of blonds."

All the news reports, in Britain and the United States,
cited a study from the World Health Organization - "a
blonde-shell study," as The Daily Star of London put it.
But none reported any scientific details from the study or
the names of the scientists who conducted it.

On "Good Morning America," Charles Gibson began a
conversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:
"There's a study from the World Health Organization, this
is for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women
and men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural
blonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth
within 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as
brunets."

Ms. Sawyer said she was "somewhat of a natural blonde."

Jeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the
anchors got the information from an ABC producer in London
who said he had read it in a British newspaper.

In London, The Sun and The Express both reported that
unnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in
Scandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected
the last true blond to hail from Finland.

The British accounts were replete with the views of
bleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow
blondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare
genes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an
endangered species.

Journalists in London said last night that the source of
the reports was probably one of several European news
agencies that are used by the British press, but it
remained unclear which one.

Tim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the
report was probably distributed by The Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency. "Several papers picked it
up," he said.

But Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press
Association, said that although it had considered running
the report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking
to the World Health Organization.

"We didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to the
World Health Organization first," she said. "They told us
that report was two years old, and had been covered at the
time. They said it had been picked up again that day by a
German news agency."

She added that she did not know which agency the
organization was referring to.

Dr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California
at San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for
blond hair "sounds patently incorrect."

"Computers are useless. They can only give you answers." (Picasso)

Well it looks pretty much 99% sure that we will be moving in on Nov 1 to
the new house. I think the only thing that stops us now are acts of
dieties and total economic collapse..so no one mention the dow for the
next few weeks..

In preperation we drove to Best Buy tonight and picked up the test core
for the wifi net. I got a linksys BEFW11S4(1) for the router/hub/wireless
ap/firewall/etc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptop

I made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up the
card, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire ether
hub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the
webinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features some
more (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)
but all in all a smooth move.

Now the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots of
funky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in ,
essentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions get
goofy inside the pit. That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet between
the AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting
11mbs and at least 60% goodness.

Some cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal works
inthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have a
microwave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bear
cat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a bad
thing? Ben or heather, if you read this years from now...well by then I
hope youare better at countermoeasures:)- )

Ok, enough testing for tonight. I gota say, being able to do this in bed
by vncing via wifi to my desktop is a blast...oh no...wifes pillow is
heading this way....DUCKKKKK

Too, too, too, true. Just you try to muck with Job's blessed Aqua
interface. Or remove the fscking dock. OSX is such a step down from
Classic with Kaleidoscope skinning the entire UI. As an artist, I resent
it deeply. (This is not in praise of Classic.) If my environment cannot
be made beautiful, in some sense I cannot live.

Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated
with fairly good ideas. Just a big turnoff. A good example would be
the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but
related, relaxation techniques including "betagenics",
hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc. (This was one of the many topics I
obsessively absorbed as a teenager.) Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo /

I have to say however that, having found this while looking for
something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms. I
particularly like their addiction to non-addiction. Additionally, the
Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.

To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular
seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some
religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize. Very
irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and

draw the pain

"Ken never wrote about this method, but he often demonstrated it in
workshops. Let us say you have a physical pain somewhere in your body. You
draw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Take
about 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefully
listening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurts
and where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes of
this the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is to
imagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay."

Works! There's this coworker - a real pain in my ass! I used my middle
finger to trace his outline for about 60 seconds. I listened to him, found
the boundary, and repeated the motion. He left my office!

... nor what color your passport?

More American exceptionalism:

"The United States is the only country in the world to tax its citizens
on a worldwide basis, irrespective of whether they spend time in the
country or whether they have assets there," said Philip Marcovici,
a Zurich-based lawyer with international law firm Baker and Mackenzie.

and perhaps even irrespective of their
current citizenship:

Under current expatriation law, there are wealth thresholds based on
net worth which lead to a presumption that a person giving up U.S.
citizenship is doing so for tax reasons.

Individuals who have given up their citizenship and who have earned
$100,000 in any one of the 10 years before expatriation, or who have a

Content-management vendor Documentum said late Thursday it plans to acquire
privately held e-Room Technologies in a deal worth about $100 million.

Documentum will issue approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock
and pay about $12.6 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of
eRoom.

Documentum makes a platform for enterprise-wide content management. ERoom
makes tools for enterprise collaboration. Its customers include Airbus,
Bausch & Lomb, Ford Motor Co., and Sony.

Documentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new Collaboration
Edition of its content-management suite. ERoom was already integrating its
tools to the Documentum platform, making an acquisition an easy target,
according to Documentum president and CEO Dave DeWalt.

With the upcoming joint product, customers will be able to collaborate in
real-time via virtual workspaces, sharing schedules, resources, and even
jointly creating content.

Content creation and management has always been a collaborative task, but
workflow has usually been delivered via a Web browser interface or even
simple e-mail -- and rarely in real-time.

For now, Documentum will sell the eRoom platform and its own
content-management system through combined sales channels. Further
integration is planned down the line, the companies said.

Does anyone know what happened to vCard support in Netscape 7.0/Mozilla
1.1?
(Not there yet in Mozilla and therefore not in the new mail engine I
presume?)

Netscape Messenger/Mozilla have LDAP LDIF import/export, but I can't
find vCard or a reference to it anywhere. I like the Netscape/Mozilla
email client. I avoid LookOut for at least two reasons: Windows Only
(my main environment is Linux with 30% on Windows) and security issues.

Now that LDAP, and the related DSML and DNS SRV record methods, are
becoming more popular, is there a decline of vCard?
Is there a standard emerging to deal with the mismatch in naming between
the two?

I've brushed with directories in the past, but I'm getting in deep along
with more PKI oriented focus. Any wisdom would be appreciated. In
particular, I'm going to start integrating smart cards into my linux and
Win32 systems and integrating them with Netscape Messenger/Mozilla and
Outlook.

Thanks

Abstract

The crucial role played by aesthetics in programming language design and the importance of elegance in
programming languages are defended on the basis of analogies with structural engineering, as presented in
Billington's The Tower and the Bridge.

This report may be used for any nonprofit purpose provided that its source is acknowledged. It will be adapted
for
inclusion in the third edition of my Principles of Programming Languages.

The Value of Analogies

Programming language design is a comparatively new activity - it has existed for less than half a century, so
it is
often worthwhile to look to older design disciplines to understand better this new activity. Thus, my book
Principles of Programming Languages: Design, Evaluation, and Implementation, grew out of a study of teaching
methods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design.
Perhaps you
have also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (FORTRAN = Model T, C = dune
buggy, etc.).

These analogies can be very informative, and can serve as ``intuition pumps'' to enhance our creativity, but
they
cannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions must
be
based on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative.

In this essay I'll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but I will base my remarks
on a
book about structural engineering, The Tower and the Bridge, by David P. Billington. Although there are many
differences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transfer
rather
directly.

According to Billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call
``the
three E's'': Efficiency, Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology,
which
Billington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three S's). We will consider each in
turn.

Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used

In structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safety
and the
issues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). Similarly, in programming language
design,
efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples where
efficiency
considerations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming
Languages). In the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing
time, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized was
programmer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN's
implicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed
for the
sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking).

Efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we
are
not comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as
programmer time. Similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are
reduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now
turn.

Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost

Whereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. In structural engineering, economy seeks
to
maximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges
are
usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design, the ``public''
that
must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these
programmers work.

Economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example,
the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost
of
computer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the
increasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of
program
maintenance compared to program development.

Other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether major
manufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some
way
by influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense), whether it has been standardized, whether
it
comes to be perceived as a ``real'' language (used by ``real programmers'') or as a ``toy'' language (used by
novices
or dilettantes), and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles, social factors are
frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming
language.

Often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are
often
unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also, many social issues, from
dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately
represented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost'' and ``benefit'' must be considered
in
seeking an economical design.

Elegance Symbolizes Good Design

``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?'' snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but Billington shows clearly the
critical
role of elegance in ``hard-nosed'' engineering.

For the Designer

It is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the
difficulty
of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples).
Structural
engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but Billington observes that the best designers don't
make
extensive use of computer models and calculation.

One reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about which
variables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this
decision is not
made well. Also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this
is
another potential source of error. Because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical
analysis
may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price of
safety is
additional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy).

Similarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a
choice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an
over-engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical.

Many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; it
vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design.
Billington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a
consequence of
an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However, the very problem that destroyed
the
Tacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided
by aesthetic principles.

According to Billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do
not
abandon it altogether). Rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is because
solutions to
structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible
solutions to a
particular problem, such as bridging a particular river. Therefore, expert designers restrict their attention
to
designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces are
unbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable.

The general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can
be
guided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this idea
by
inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. He adds
(p.
21), ``When the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.'' In other words, the choice of
form is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and
economical design). If we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design.

The same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which the
interaction
of features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let our
aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having
to
check all the possible interactions.

For the User

In this case, what's good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge
that
looks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which
features may ``explode'' if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well-designed
bridge
gives us confidence when we cross it. So also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should
reinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in the
consequences
of our actions.

We accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable to
sustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won't much matter that it was beautiful on the
outside.
So also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation
of a
deep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their
(unwarranted)
confidence.

In summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As a
consequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or
programming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited
value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize the
preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages:
The Elegance Principle

Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good.

The Programming Language as Work Environment

There are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programming
language is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortable
and
safe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that
take
place within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop?

A programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer's
fatigue
and frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator,
encouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines'' and work as a
natural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine'' by encouraging
the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programming
language should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs.

Through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example, in the variety of
its features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may
represent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programming
language can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; by
neglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention.
Out of
sight, out of mind.

Acquiring a Sense of Elegance

Aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined
sense
of elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive
experience
in design, which, especially in Europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers.
Because of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each
competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The public
also
critiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along
with that of the designers.

So also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively -
and criticize, revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people's designs
and try
to improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing''
comes
along.

I propose they rename it "Charlie Heston High" and maybe the students
will learn to take AR-15s with extended military-spec scopes and .223
high-velocity ammo and start plinking innocent civilians at random in
the suburbs of Washington. That's far more effectual than blowing
oneself up in a bus.

In America these days, it seems that violence ascribed to any political
doctrine foreign to Bushism is vile and repugnant. But random violence
is entertainment and intrigue.

A couple of ex-FBI "consultants" speaking on the shootings in DC were
quoted as saying the shooters, presumed to be a pair, were getting a
"heroin-like high" from each successful kill and that they "for
whatever reason decided to level the playing field, thumbing their nose
at law enforcement and society."

See? Just a couple of kids having fun with Daddy's semi-automatic
hunting rifle. Harmless!

When a settler goes postal and kills some Palestinians they are treated
as a criminal, not celebrated in word and song.

But you knew that.

When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target
children with a homicide-bomb, they are careful to dip the shrapnel in

when brickbats or fox exposes the folly of government they do so to
accomplish a specific end; dumping truckload after truckload of bad acts
proves their point: stupidity and greed typify government, therefore any
government is too much government.

I call PacBell/SBC every two or three months about a recurring problem
we have at my house:

We get a phone bill every month for someone who no longer lives at our
house for a phone line which has been disconnected for over three years
and the account balance is (drum roll please) $0.00! Sometimes the
people I talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me
that the phone number doesn't exist. Some people are able to locate the
account but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we
could get a bill sent to us for that account. Some people can locate the
account and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years
and that the amount owed is $0.00 and then they say somthing along the
lines of "Huh?" or "I'm not sure what's going on... Hold please." And
eventually I have similar conversations with their managers and the
account representatives and billing people and their managers and their
managers' managers ad naseum.

The outcome of every phone call is that they'll "look into it" and fix
the problem and I might receive one or two more bills depending on when
it's resolved. So I wait a month or two and send the bills back marked
"Not at this address, please fsck off." and then eventually call them
back and go through the whole process again. Lately I just explain to
the phone jockeys that I know it's not their fault and I'm not mad at
them and it's just not their day because I'm about to give them hell.
Then I give them the opportunity to have me yell at their boss which
they seem all too happy to do.

At least it gives me a positive way to vent my aggressions and it's a
lot cheaper than seeing a therapist.

Perplexed,
Elias

I find this all incredibly funny really. Congress _and_ the courts

applied. For the most part, these rules are coming down to whose
friend you happen to be, how nefarious the defendant party is, and how
asleep the judge is behind the case (asleep/self-interested/bought).
Its giving me a real cynical view on being a lawyer, thats for sure.

Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the

Alberta, and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces, is
definitely not happy with the current arrangement. Some of this has to
do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured. When I
was last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting
something like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over
several distinct issues.

The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse
that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their
interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in
Ottawa. While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to
Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token
representation in the federal government. While I'm not clear on
exactly how the government works up there, representation is not
entirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern
provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have
substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire
province of Alberta.

The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta
as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so
much as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the
sparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having
fewer people. Or something like that. The Canadian government is less
restricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like
having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces,
Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities. It is
essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the
inter-mountain West of the US. Unlike the US case though, the rest of
Canada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those tax
dollars from Alberta. OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.

I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totally
clear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial
unfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a little
fuzzy on some of the details. What I do know is that on average the
Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and
the sentiment has been getting worse over the years.

Internet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro

NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and
ask for our votes.

Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.

In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.

That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.

Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones
through any of those channels.

The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.

His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money
in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication
mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.

No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society,
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different
unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.

The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.

When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them
to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60
percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail
accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.

Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better
ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient
groups.

But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter
an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without
opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage
the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam
advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail.
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

You have multiple generations of
peasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a
human parts of the property package.

When I'd read that "getting legal title
can take 20 years", when I believe that
1 year ought to be more than sufficient,
(and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd
assumed that we were talking about the
urban poor.

If I see people living in mansions, or
even in suburban subdivisions, I assume
they didn't have too much trouble with
their titles.

If I see people living in shanties and
haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume
their parcels weren't exactly recorded
on the government maps, or paid for with
a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant
lots have shotgun wielding men presumably
intent on keeping them "development" free.

Now, it may be that "Manhattanites' view
of America" to say that outside of Metro
Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or
two (Cebu?), everything else (literally)
is the boondocks. But going on that very
broad assumption, I guess I'm describing
the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience:
the paisanos (who leave behind those who
remain on a patron's rural land) move to
Manila, and (the second assumption) squat
in shantytowns there, at least until they
can line up a middle-class job.

So, going on two large assumptions, I can
come up with a scenario under which title
would take 20 years: a shantytown arises
somewhere in the midst of a section (or
whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the
land) and it takes decades of arguing to
put together a package which somehow can
both compensate the owner and record lots
for the inhabitants. Just transferring
title to an existing lot, between parties
who have money, ought not to be a problem.

The obvious solution, at least to us
barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is
to "introduce market mechanisms". It is
left as an exercise to come up with one
which works when many of the agents (are
perceived to) have negligible NPV.

Pg 177:
In another country, a local newspaper, intrigued by our evidence of

official residence had a recorded title. It did not.

Pg 92:
The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square

informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go
as high as US$3,000.

I'd have made the same assumption you did. De Soto says that isn't
correct. You can find mansions that don't have title. A lot of them,
in fact. But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise
participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.

The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,
which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if
in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and
conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate
of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the
whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly
paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was
not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent
country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...
between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence
under Lorenzo the Magnificent?

--------------

De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those
who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do
not. The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property. What they
don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital
and allow it to start growing. Their property can only be exchanged
with a small section of people who know them personally.

TONY BLAIR's special relationship with George W. Bush is under
considerable strain. Not only do the two disagree on Yassir Arafat's
tenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started
telling disparaging anecdotes about the President.

Baroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good
friend Tony Blair' recently in Brighton. Blair, Bush and Jacques
Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of
the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in
Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'

Claim: President George W. Bush proclaimed, "The problem with
the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur."

Status: False.

Origins: Yet another French fried "George W. Bush is dumb"
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. "The problem with the
French," Bush afterwards confided in Blair, "is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur."

The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed "my good friend Tony Blair" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.

Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. "I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,"
Campbell told The Post. "If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke."

This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the "village idiot" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.

Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this

Political mail (the snail kind) doesn't bother me. I like it a lot of the
time, because as crap as it is at least it's not the kind of info you get
on TV. Particularly for small time local politics, it's the best way to
get information.

but what matters is that mail is speech, and political email has to be as
well protected as any other political speech. Spam is *the* tool for
dissident news, since the face that it's unsolicited means that recipients
can't be blamed for being on a mailing list.

Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. "I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,"
Campbell told The Post. "If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke."

So some guy failed to reach the source, but instead got spin doctor to
deny it. Wot, is he thick enough to expect official confirmation
that, yes, Blair is going around casting aspersions on Bush???

It's an amusing anecdote, I don't know if it's true or not, but certainly
nothing here supports the authoritative sounding conclusion "Status: False".

That depends on how the list is collected, or
even on what the senders say about how the list
is collected. Better to just put it on a website,
and that way it can be surfed anonymously. AND
it doesn't clutter my inbox.

TONY BLAIR's special relationship with George W. Bush is under
considerable strain. Not only do the two disagree on Yassir Arafat's
tenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started
telling disparaging anecdotes about the President.

Baroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good

Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of
the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in
Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'

Exsqueeze me, but what part of "I don't know if it's true or not"
did you fail to grok? I personally doubt it simply because I never

Next time I hear a joke, I promise not to laugh until I have checked

There's lots of similar places. Saskatchewan, for example, once
shared with Iceland the distinction of most telephone connections per
capita, and for a long time shared the internet penetration lead with
Iceland (Sask is a land-locked massive expanse of ultra-flat dust with
only two rivers and farm sizes measured in the

It's still curious Iceland leads. Maybe there's just a deep cultural

I do this all the time, It's alot easier then you think if the original

just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren't as cheap ;)

5. Makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a

individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer Java as it is

I'm fairly confused here, with Procmail.
I know this isn't a procmail list per-se; feel free to answer my questions in
private email to r_gilmanhunt@hotp.com.

I've looked for web-stuff to answer this question but I can't find anything
specific on this scenario.

Here's the situation.
I have a global /etc/procmailrc file. It works, and when I insert stuff into
it for logging (LOGFILE=/root/procmail.log, VERBOSE=yeah. LOGABSTRACT=all) it
shows up where I expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log) At the end of
this file, I use
:0fw
| spamc
to call spamassassin.

Also in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it's one of the evils we do
for our corporate masters) (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed
that they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about
future lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made. Discussion
on this point is immaterial)
:0
* ? test -d $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR || mkdir -p --mode=750 $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR
{ }
:0 c
$SAVEAT

I have several users where I forward certain spams to /dev/null . . .their
procmailrc file (/home/$user/.procmailrc) looks like this:
:0
* ^From: .*spermfun.com
/dev/null

Now I've got a person who needs a copy of her inbound emails sent to another
email address (outside the company), so I've got this recipe in her
/home/$user/.procmailrc file:
:0 c
!user@domain.tld

It almost looks like procmail's not running a user's copy recipe after a
global copy recipe, except that I can replace that user's one with
:0
* ^Subject: .*test
procmail.holder
and get the same result.

The result, to put it succinctly, is "nothing". No forwards go out, no files
are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the
user/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun
example above) and still nothing. However, I can redirect those other
messages. In other words- just this user's procmailrc file is not working-
other users have no problems.

Any suggestions would be helpful :)

*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*
By Declan McCullagh
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT
http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html

*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that
would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy
surveillance by police and spy agencies.*

A discussion draft
released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every
Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the
right to be anonymous online.

The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice
and Industry Canada
, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step
in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to
conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion
draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in
early 2003.

Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form,
Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and
combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting
these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the
Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty
, which the country is in the
process of considering.

If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the
possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet
providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and
permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find "hidden
electronic and digital devices" that a suspect might be concealing. In
most circumstances, a court order would be required for government
agents to conduct Internet monitoring.

Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of
Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have
endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty
, which has
drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups.
Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted
,
or ratified, the treaty.

Michael Geist , a professor at the
University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the
justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems
weak.

"It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the
changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to
make changes," Geist said. "To me that's not a particularly convincing
argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority,
make that case."

Geist added that "there's nothing in the document that indicates (new
powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant
number of cases where police have run into problems."

Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is
compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure
their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention
orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act
, but it
applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.

"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and
Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical
capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national
security agencies," according to the proposal. Companies would be
responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.

Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center
(EPIC) who specializes in international law, says
the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. "Their
proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not
just Internet providers," Andrews said. "The cybercrime treaty deals
only with computer data." EPIC opposes

the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and
does not adequately respect privacy rights.

Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs
of Police recommends "the establishment of a national database" with
personal information about all Canadian Internet users. "The
implementation of such a database would presuppose that service
providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"
the draft says.

Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an
activist with Privacy International, calls the database "a dumb idea."

"Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous
mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet
anonymously," Hosein said.

A representative for George Radwanski
, Canada's privacy commissioner, said
the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not "have any comments on
the paper as it stands."

Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca
no later than Nov. 15.

I'm not sure what you mean by "let's you and him fight", but it is
important to remember that England was in control of Ireland
for 300 years ...

Exactly -- "let's you and him fight" is a
way of dealing with troublesome populations
by moving them next to one another, so they
give each other, and not the Man, grief*.

So by my understanding (and, you all will
understand, with tongue firmly in cheek):

Ireland: Irish? Uppity barbarians overly
fond of "risings". Scots? More uppity
barbarians overly fond of "risings".
Why not plonk down a bunch of the latter
next to the former and kill two birds
with one stone?

Israel: Ex-ottomans? Uppity barbarians
(didn't they help kick out the Ottomans?)
Zionists? Uppity sorts who aren't happy
with perfectly good land in Uganda. Why
not plonk down a bunch of the latter next
to the former and kill two birds with one
stone?

but not:

India: in which the muslims and hindus were
originally intermixed to some degree,
but Partioned due to their own conflict,
not due to English resettlement policy.

Canada: in which the french and english were
already established, and it was just the
balance of power on the continent that
determined events in the colonies. The
Acadians got resettled, but they don't
seem to have been that good for picking
fights with their neighbors, so no one
had them plonked down next door.

given "one man, one vote", immediately
deduce "one less man, one less vote" --

This is my Netscape 7.0 Review.

o They finally got the email search speed back up to
where it was in 4.7.x
o Setting up user mail accounts doesn't have that really
odd, sometimes it lets me sometimes it doesn't problem that
previous versions had.
o I still have to manually update all my address books by
hand but at least it lets me import them as Netscape 4.x
address books (there's not 6.x import as they just assume
it works--which it doesn't)
o The mail filters are still broken and have the same problem that
I've tried to report since 4.0.2 where you can't store a mail
filter of the type: Age in days, is greater than, 21 (or some number)
Gawd I'd really wish they'd fix that freakin' bug, it's the single
biggest annoyance that I have with Netscape as it's one of the
most effective anti-spam tools that I have.
o Webex doesn't support Netscape 7.0 and the plugin doesn't
work which causes problems when you want to use Webex to
work on something with someone remotely.

I've given up trying to report bugs and any changes to the
source I send always get lost.

Argh, I forgot to exclude aaxine from the %files when using "--without

The current "fr6.1" spec file fixes this...

Nope, this is "normal" as Red Hat removed all mp3 support from 8.0 because
of patent and royalty issues :-(
On freshrpms.net, you can find the xmms mp3 plugin as I said, but also
libmad, lame (mp3 encoder), and soon mpg321 as I often used it myself.
Many other players can also play mp3 files, like alsaplayer, xine, mplayer.

like mplayer not working also and gives black screen

This is not normal though...
Try "mplayer -vo help" then try usinf various output methods to see if some
do work or not.

Hi,

For kernel-sources, I get :

Now, first of all, this doesn't really tell me what the two options are ;)
Second, is there some way I can tell apt-get to install either ? This is
done from automatic build scripts so I'd like it to proceed anyway.

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in "AllowDuplicated",
meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same
time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one
version available.

'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it...

When I worked as a PC repair tech for a Computer store chain, I did

And my IBM Intellistation would lock up instantly .. now this is actually

Hi all,

I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is
that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually
testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality
people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from
that, right? ;-)

I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages
should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and
maybe others, who knows ;-)

Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :
- Recompile the "alsa-driver" source rpm for your running kernel
(you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)
- Install this "alsa-driver" package
- Install the "alsa-libs" package
- Install the "alsa-utils" package

Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your
/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/
(very complete and very good documentation!)
Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)

Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need
to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) "by hand" and
insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! ("dmesg" to
check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with
e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.

With "aplay" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You
can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...
hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3
files... that's it!

It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only
thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't
imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the
/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly
%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d
structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the
default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's
development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static
libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against
which the "alsa-driver" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the
rpm release, so does the architecture!).

I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!

Download :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/

Current spec files :
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec
(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )

PS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply
run "xine -A alsa09" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)

I've an XMMS Alsa module I've been using for a while now at:

Also there is alsaplayer rpms there too:
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i386.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i686.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.src.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71.spec

Good luck. Both were build on an RH 7.3 box with errata current as of the date of
the build. I'm running (null) RH beta now and I recall that alsa-xmms still works, I
can not remember if alsaplayer needs a --rebuild.

As an aside, alsaplayer is really maturing into a versitile app, I've been packaging
for many releases now.

I've scripted the alsa-xmms cvs build, so it's easy to spin another one if these
rpms do not work on (null).

Hi,

some time now the following messages were haunting me:

automount[11593]: attempting to mount entry /home/dude

It just came to my attention, that only freshrpm benefitting hosts showed this
up. I grepped through the binaries and found referrences to /home/dude.

# grep /home/dude /usr/bin/*
Binary file /usr/bin/aaxine matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gentoo matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gphoto2 matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gtkam matches
...

I am now relaxed again ;), and pass this info on. Probably Matthias Saou
himself is "dude", and some package has hardwired a path in his build
directory. It would be nice to find out which and fix it, but I am using too
many of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down.

Regards, Axel.

Hi,

First of all, sorry for not replying to your private email from last week,
but I really don't have a slight idea of what could be causing this!
- Is this with different DVDs or a single one?
- Is this using OSS or ALSA? Have you tried both?
- Is this using binariy packages or recompiling source ones?

I remember a user having trouble with a particular DVD ever since upgrading
libdvdcss to a recent version, but haven't heard the end of the story.

No problems whatsoever. Currently apt.freshrpms.net is running 7.3 with apt

Hello,

Has anyone made a working source RPM for dvd::rip for Red Hat 8.0?
Matthias has a spec file on the site for 0.46, and there are a couple of
spec files lying around on the dvd::rip website, including one I patched
a while ago, but it appears that the Makefile automatically generated is
trying to install the Perl libraries into the system's, and also at the
moment dvd::rip needs to be called with PERLIO=stdio as it seems to not
work with PerlIO on RH8's Perl.

Not too sure what the cleanest way to fix this is - anyone working on
this?

Thanks,

BlogStart:

**Dublin**: something from the archives. Daev Walsh forwards an article from
The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''. This story is also immortalised
in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track. Billy
was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I
now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely
legal, way to make money.

BlogEnd:
LinkText: Billy in the Bowl

From: daev
Subject: The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler

A story of my new neighbourhood...

The Irish Digest July 1964

The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler

The handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.
Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life

DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the
architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of
beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes. Many of these
beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one
who campaigned among the working class. This was "Billy In The Bowl"

The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means
of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels. Seated in this "
bowl ", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground
with wooden plugs, one in each hand.

Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been
born without legs. Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing
him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an
unusually handsome face.

This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating
sympathetic passers-by from their small change.

The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many
lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century
Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would
come along.

He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his
black curly hair, never failed to halt the females. The fact that such a
handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.

"Billy in the Bowl", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily
owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were
substantial sums of money. The more he managed to get the more he could
indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.

As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.
The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening
as dusk, was falling. The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing
through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on
Dublin's North Quays.

When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a
ditch which skirted the lane. As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the
beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.

Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay
concealed. She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two
powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.

In a few minutes it was all over. The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy
was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his " bowl ", his victirn's
purse snug in his coat pocket. An hour after the robbery the woman was
found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her
assailant. And, as "Billy in the Bowl" had figured, nobody would suspect a
deformed beggar.

Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting
the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or Stoneybatter.

On one occasion " Billy in "the Bowl " tried his tactics on a sturdy
servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to
strangle her. The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder
and caused a great stir.

Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months
"Billy in the Bowl" was forced to desert his usual haunts. Around this
period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first
case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.

Months passed and "Billy in the Bowl" reverted once again to his old
pasttime. A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and
robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a
nightly patrol was placed on the district. But the beggar still rolled
along in his "bowl" pitied and unsuspected. Then came the night that
finished Billy's career of crime.

Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment
after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to
hear shouts for help. Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the
ditch.

Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and
tried to pull her into the ditch. She proved much too strong for him,
however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.

Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring. Pulling out her
large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.

The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the
district and brought people dashing to the scene. Among them was a member
of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.

"Billy in the Bowl" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but
they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl. The
Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive
Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed
and giggled as they wended their way home at night.

Folks,

Some of you seem to have hardcoded honor as the default catalogue server.
There are three catalogue only servers running now, and honor is acting
as a nomination only server. Tonight we will be completely turning off
catalogue support on honor, so if you are specifying honor with the -rs
option, please take it out and let the agents discover a closeby
catalogue server.

cheers,
vipul.

Hello all,
I get problems with the latest nightly build from Spamassassin with
VMailMgr + OMail-Admin.
It scans the mail and gives it an :

X-Spam-Status: No, hits=11.4 required=7.0

Can someone look at the code for it? Maybe because option -F is gone?

Yes, please do send it on, and I'll add it to the non-spam corpus.

To date, the scores evolved by SpamAssassin are very biased towards
non-HTML, non-newsletter-ish mail. This release should be different, as
I've been spending the last month signing up a "nonspamtrap" to every
legit newsletter I can find ;)

This should mean that tests which match common-enough newsletter practices
will no longer get such high scores once we re-run the GA.

As the subject line indicates, I'm sure these are stupid questions, but
I'm having trouble getting SA working like I understand it should work,
and have about given up on trying to figure it out myself.

If a user has a line like:

whitelist_from *@yahoogroups.com

in his .spamassassin/user_prefs file, does that line not, in effect,
tell the program to take no action at all against any mail coming in from
yahoogroups.com, or is there still checking being done against it? And if
the latter, what does he need to place in user_prefs to cause such mail
to be ignored? I'm testing SA here with a few users who happen to be on
yahoogroups lists, before deploying it system-wide, and although the above
line has been added to their user_prefs files, much of their list mail is
still going to the spam folder due to all the usual things you would
expect to trigger SA.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Justin, on a related note -- I didn't include the spamtrap stuff

Hi Folks,

I have just installed spamassassin 2.31 in my postfix MTA server.

At first, I would like to test it just in my email account before
applying it to the wole site.

I configured just as in the INSTALL file:

5. Create a .forward...
"|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #user"
6. create a .procmailrc
:0fw
| /usr/bin/spamassassin -c
/etc/mail/spamassassin/rules

But the spams get trought it untouched. When I run it by the hand:

cat sample-spam.txt | /usr/bin/spamassassin -c
/etc/mail/spamassassin/rules

it does tag it as spam and send me the email.

what should I look at?

Thank you,

There is a whitelist RBL now! Ironport's Bonded Sender is
basically a whitelist RBL where you post a bond to get on the
list, and then lose the bond if you end up spamming from that IP
address (or something like that). http://www.bondedsender.org/

4. DNSBL: Only certifies an ip address, not who is using it. As it is
currently used, DNSBL allows you to look up if some IP address
has been
blacklisted by someone. What I haven't seen is a service that
provides a
DNS based whitelist.

There's a practical reason for that: Any DNS list (white or
black) works
only for a limited number of IPs; the set of unlisted IPs is
much larger
than the set in the DNS list. If you have to make a binary decision to
accept or reject, you'll be wrong less often if you reject the
blacklist
and accept everything else, rather than accept the whitelist and reject
everything else.

A whitelist is only helpful when (a) you only want mail from a limited
number of known sources, or (b) you can use a secondary system
like SA to
decide what to do with the vast unlisted masses. Most MTAs still make
only the binary decision, because the secondary computation is
expensive.

With SA's cooperation, though, it might be worth a try. Even better if
one could get commercial anti-spam outfits to agree to factor it in.

I'm a bit surprised that any spams hit this one. Did somebody forward a
spam that then went into a corpus?

My corpus is quite clean and I get spam hits.

yes, it's being frequently forged already.

1.582 2.226 1.279 0.64 0.39 GAPPY_TEXT

Gappy text in a non-spam? It must be a H E A D L I N E or something.
Maybe just remove space from the list of "gap" characters?

For 2.50, we could try to figure out which nonspams are hitting and
improve the rule.

BTW I subscribe to the Media Unspun newsletter, and it and a few others
regularly use that H E A D L I N E thing.

splitting it into 2, one that matches gappy text with punctuation chars,
one that matches spaces between the chars, would probably help. if
anyone's bothered, I'd suggest filing a bug.

I just recently converted our SA setup to use Amavisd into our Postfix

That's another argument for a "HLL" (Habeas Licensee List) which would be less
inclusive than a test for the mark of for HIL, but more timely and accurate. When an
ip address is on the HLL it could get a huge negative score, bigger than the Habeas
mark alone.

The GA run on the current corpus is yielding an average (mean)
score for false-positives of about 10 points, which is higher
than before. There's some tweaking to be done yet (rule
elimination and such), so that will likely fall, but -15 might
not be enough of a correction in many situations. I will set
the scores for the Habeas stuff and the Ironport stuff to be
sensible given:

a) estimated likeliness of compliance with Habeas/Bonded sender
rules, and
b) score correction level needed to achieve purposes of those projects.

Using the score-ranges stuff and my aggressive anti-FP evaluation code,
BTW, yielded an average FP of 5.7 points, with 0.67% FPs and 96.57%
overall accuracy -- but I notice you went back to the other method.

Just because it's documented doesn't mean it's a good thing.

I work for an ISP. We provide SpamAssassin to our customers. I got email
today from a support tech saying that "spamassassin -t" reports that a
message is probably spam even when it's not, and why is this, and can we
change it? I thought about why it is, and the only answer I could come up
with was, "it was easier for the programmer that way". That's an answer, I
guess, but her point was that this is going to generate support calls, and
support calls cost us time and money.

Why would a customer use `spamassassin -t` without understanding what it does?

You can't, because there isn't one, yet. Habeas is using a
combination of copyright and trademark law to protect their
sender warranties. They hope to patent the system, but they
have not been ISSUED a patent.

TMDAers, have you seen this before?

No, but thanks for pointing it out.

Yup. TMDA's core functionality was fully established before even the
filing date.

Anyone with experience in this area have a recommendation on whether
this should be pursued or not?

Actually, I want to avoid that -- I've already removed spamproxyd

When they're in the distro, *we* have to support them -- which is
not necessarily a good thing when we didn't write them in the first
place, or when the coder in question may not *want* us to maintain
them. :(

I would be in favor of creating new SpamAssassin CVS modules and
Bugzilla categories for other clients (provided there is sufficient
interest and a maintainer).

yeah, I'd be with that -- as long as they have a maintainer ;)

however regarding CVS, I'd say many projects might find it easier
to just sign up as a new proj with sf.net -- it might save them having
to go through us (not sure, depends on what sf.net's procedures
are like).

Hey, look at that!

DROPPRIVS If set to`yes' procmail will drop all privileges
it might have had (suid or sgid). This is only
useful if you want to guarantee that the bottom half
of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on behalf
of the recipient.

Of course, removing setuid/gid bits on programs that don't need it is
always a good idea. A general rule of system administration: don't give
out permissions unless you absolutely need to. ;)

Method of anti-spam

Abstract

A method of anti-spam is to set an optional trustcode, or a trustlist, or
at least a trustweb based on online mail delivery at a recipient's e-mail
address. A mail sender is compelled at the first time to deliver a mail
by way of: taking the way of "Visiting trustweb and sending online", or
enclosing the recipient's trustcode in the mail and sending in another way
other than the mentioned. After the sender's e-mail address has been stored
automatically in the recipient's trustlist, the sender may send mails to
the same recipient in whatever the ways feasible.

Sounds a lot like TMDA to me. :( Filing date is July 26, 2001, granted
May 16, 2002.

I took a bit of time to review what is on the above URL. If I were a news

From tmda.net/history.html:

The first release of TMDA in April 2001 was essentially a rewrite of TMS in
Python,

April 2001 is earlier than July 26, 2001... prior art..

If you think you can survive it, please fight... When I found that patent I
found others that were just common sense, things that any geek could implement
with his script/shell-language of choice; and it's time for someone to get the
medias attention on what's going on.
Basically this is the new wave of "namenappers"; it used to be domainnames,
not it's all the basic general ideas they can think off/find on the web that
they're patenting.

They are crawling through the pages and send their "offers" to all addresses
they find. Theo won't every receive any offers as he doesn't publish his

------- Additional Comments From daniel@roe.ch 2002-08-28 09:15 -------
3. usage of just like (ie. without ) which is obsolete
(not sure whether some mailers still produce such broken html)
4. tag argument values sometimes enclosed in "", sometimes not
5. colour args without # in front of hex rgb code
6. colour args with non-6-digit rgb code (typo)
7. onMouseOver et al in nonconsistent case throughout the document

Mind, those are just ideas. I'm pretty sure some or even most of them
are not working in practice, but they might be worth checking out.

Well if you're talking about epiphany, which is in January, then yes it is
5 months.Some people do celebrate Christmas on january 6th, or even the 13th.

But I am certain that what you are thinking is the correct thought.

Please don't flame me. Just trying to be humerous =)

Matt Kettler said:
On an unrelated, but similarly amusing note, a spam I received (and was
tagged by SA) today began with:

I bet you haven't even realized that Christmas is just 5 months away,

did you?

Strangely, no I wasn't aware that Christmas was 5 months away. Here in
the US Christmas is a bit less than 4 months away. Where exactly is
the "international month line" anyway? I've never seen the -74400
timezone before, but I bet it qualifies as INVALID_DATE_TZ_ABSURD :)

What has MIME to do with it? I read in perldoc M:A that your suggestion
is less expensive, but how does that help S:A?

M:A, for some reason, changes its base class depending on whether the
incoming message is mime or not. Therefore the Mail::Internet methods
suddenly become unavailable for MIME messages...

(you do *not* want to know what I thought of that when I found it ;)

As a new user of SA, I guess I'm having trouble connecting the dots. If
I understand you: If I don't use the "nomime" => 1 option and I recieve
MIME mail, the Mail::Internet modules become unavailable.

Unavailable for which? MA? SA? What do these methods do? Does this
mean my incoming MIME mail won't be checked by SA unless I specify
"nomime" => 1?

Thanks,
Phil

OK guys -- I reckon it's now Good Enough, modulo some minor score
tweaking, or commenting of some more broken/high-FP-ing rules.

What do you all think? are we ready to go? anyone run into any trouble
with the new autoconf code, or found a bug from the merge of that spamc
BSMTP-support patch?

I expect there *will* be a 2.41 BTW.

I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus? To me, it looks
like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.

If I were a spammer, I'd simply set up a server, send out my spam with the
Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I'd been reported.
Then I'd simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP. As
long as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is
directing people to, I'm home free.

Since I can set up spamassassin to I don't "lose" any email, what do I gain
by making it easier for spam to get through??

What do you all think? are we ready to go? anyone run into any trouble
with the new autoconf code, or found a bug from the merge of that spamc
BSMTP-support patch?

I just checked out b2_4_0 from CVS and 'make test' fails horribly.

It seems to be looking in my site_perl SpamAssassin code, not the build
directory.

Example error:

Failed to run FROM_AND_TO_SAME_5 SpamAssassin test, skipping:
(Can't locate object method "check_for_from_to_same" via package
"Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus" at
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm line
1701.
)

Anyone else seeing this?

Do you have a dialup or something more modern ? 134MB of messages
zipped would probably compress pretty well - under 50MB I'd guess with all
the similarity in the headers and such. You could zip each of the 10 sets
individually and upload them somewhere.

How about random sampling lots of public mailing lists via gmane or
something similar, manually cleaning it (distributing that load over a
number of people) and then relying on your clever code and your rebalancing
script to help further cleanse it? The "problem" with the ham is it tends
to be much more tied to one person (not just intimate, but unique) than the
spam.

I save all incoming email for ten days (gzipped mbox format) before it rolls
over and disappears. At any one time I think I have about 8,000-10,000
messages. Most of it isn't terribly personal (which I would cull before
passing along anyway) and much of it is machine-generated, so would be of
marginal use. Finally, it's all ham-n-spam mixed together. Do we call that
an omelette or a Denny's Grand Slam?

Skip
[Tim]
Another area for potentially fruitful study: it's clear that the
highest-value indicators usually appear "early" in msgs, and for spam
there's an actual reason for that: advertising has to strive
to get your attention early. So, for example, if we only bothered to
tokenize the first 90% of a msg, would results get worse?

[Neil Schemenauer]
Spammers could exploit this including a large MIME part at the beginning
of the message. In pratice that would probably work fine.

Note that timtest.py's current tokenizer only looks at decoded text/* MIME
sections (or raw message text if no MIME exists); spammers could put
megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn't even be looked at
(except that the email package has to parse non-text/* parts well enough to
skip over them, and tokens for the most interesting parts of Content-{Type,
Disposition, Transfer-Encoding} decorations are generated for all MIME
sections).

Schemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers putting
arbitrary amounts of "nice text" in the preamble area (after the headers and
before the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, but
which appear first in the file so are latched on to by Graham's scoring
scheme.

But I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that they
exist . Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that no
particular scheme will gain dominance, and there's no percentage for
spammers in trying to fool just one scheme. Even if they did, for the kind
of scheme we're using here they can't *know* what "nice text" is, not unless
they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their
messages to each different one. At that point they'd be doing targeted
marketing, and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously.

I've got a test set here that's the last 3 and a bit years email to
info@ekit.com and info@ekno.com - it's a really ugly set of 20,000+
messages, currently broken into 7,000 spam, 9,000 ham, 9,000 currently
unclassified. These addresses are all over the 70-some different
ekit/ekno/ISIConnect websites, so they get a LOT of spam.

As well as the usual spam, it also has customers complaining about
credit card charges, it has people interested in the service and
asking questions about long distance rates, &c &c &c. Lots and lots
of "commercial" speech, in other words. Stuff that SA gets pretty
badly wrong.

I'm currently mangling it by feeding all parts (text, html, whatever
else :) into the filters, as well as both a selected number of headers
(to, from, content-type, x-mailer), and also a list of
(header,count_of_header). This is showing up some nice stuff - e.g. the
X-uidl that stoopid spammers blindly copy into their messages.

I did have Received in there, but it's out for the moment, as it causes
rates to drop.

I'm also stripping out HTML tags, except for href="" and src="" - there's
so so much goodness in them (note that I'm only keeping the contents of
the attributes).

Are you sure that's in a text/plain MIME section? I've seen that many times

it's something a non-MIME aware reader will show you).

*nod* I know - on my todo is to feed the prologue into the system as well.

else, it'll pick up most virus email real quick.

Hi

I've just installed SpamAssassin and relevant modules.
Just tried the initial test:

spamassassin -t nonspam.out

and got back:

Broken Pipe

I've also tried using the -P and --pipe option but to
no avail.

Any help greatly appreciated. BTW - I'm no great Perl
expert!

rgds

Peter

Oh well, I guess there are other anti-spam options out there.

Well, (a) you don't HAVE to upgrade, and (b) what you are doing has never
been safe in the first place because SpamAssassin 2.31-and-before doesn't
do any kind of file locking while it writes to the mailbox and doesn't
promise to return the proper failure code on disk-full conditions, etc.

If you're still willing to live with (b), all you need is a little shell
script to run spamassassin:

----------
#!/bin/sh
# call this file "spamassassin-wrapper" and chmod +x it
{
echo "From $1 `date`"
sed -e '1{/^From /d;}' | spamassassin
echo ''
} >> $MAIL
----------

And then use

fetchmail --mda 'spamassassin-wrapper %F'

and you should be all set.

I think this is a Razor bug/glitch triggered when file permissions

I heard on the Razor list in the past...

Theo, does it work now that you /dev/null'd the logfile?

- version number (says "cvs")
- tag tree as "Rel" this time too

I won't bother tagging with Rel, IMO; I don't think we should
rely on the version control system inside our code, so I've just
put a line in Mail/SpamAssassin.pm instead. I will of course
tag with a release *label* though.

Thank you Lars for your reply to my query.

SA doesnt do any of these. It is probably a function of whatever scanning
system/MDA
you're using (amavis, procmail, whatever). What exactly are you using?

I am using SpamAssassin as part of the MailScanner package (using sendmail
as the MTA). It integrates nicely in there, and shares a configuration file
with SA. All very neat.

SA in itself does nothing really. You need a frontend (procmail, amavis,
etc)
at some point in the mail delivery chain that can hand over the message
to SA and do whatever other processing you want.

I thought that SA rated a message with a certain score, then did a certain
action (such as store | deliver | delete) based on the configuration given.
I was hoping there were some other actions that I could custom-program in.

Again, many thanks,

Adrian

Perl doesn't complain that it can't find PerMsgStatus.pm but the function
check_for_content_type_just_html(). Do you probably have some old rules
files still lurking around? This test existed in 2.31 but is gone/was
renamed with 2.40.

What about some reality check rules. Yeah, you can pack in lots of things
into the header to try and get some negative points, but do they all make
sense in combination. Can you have a Pine message id in the same header
with an Outlook Express one or a Mutt User-Agent?

Yes, this is a big bonus of meta rules (new in 2.40); we can now
e.g. check for an Outlook-style forwarded message, and not give
it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from
Outlook.

I think the headers should be paid special attention to. The message
content of something from the NY Times or Lockergnome might look spammy, but
usually they don't forge or fake anything in the header. Tone down the
negative scores and ding them extra for any obvious forgeries.

When we get more (good) "nice" tests, the GA will assign lower
scores to them. I think the current problem is that there are
very few really good nice tests in the current rulebase, and lots
of +ve tests that those newsletters hit, giving the GA a big
problem to solve.

BTW, I've been thinking a little about the RPMs and other packages.
Already the PLD guys are distributing 3 rpms:

- perl-Mail-SpamAssassin

the perl modules.

- spamassassin

the "spamassassin" and "spamd" scripts,
spamd rc-file etc.

- spamassassin-tools

mass-check, masses directory stuff, etc.
for generating rescore data from corpora.

This seems like a good way to do it; this way, stuff which just needs
the perl modules doesn't need to require the full RPM be installed,
with RC files in init.d etc.

It's been adopted in the distributed .spec file, anyway.

Theo, BTW, what's the eval test you add in the tvd version of the RPM?

It's possible...I performed the update via "rpm -U"...which, of course,
created all the new rulesets as "xx_rulename.cf.rpmnew" Crud. I'll have
to start moving things around.

you look to have 2 versions of spamd installed. The one running from

but the one you run from the commandline seems to be a 2.4x version.

I would find that old version of SA and blow it away.

Assuming there isn't a better way for Lotus Notes users, we could
create a "Precedence: spam" convention. The only two Precedence:

"list". Adding a "spam" header makes sense given the convention.

2.43+ (but update to 2.41 now).

I would think adding new rules to, or removing broken rules from, 2.4x
would require some discussion first. but new GA'd scores are definitely
worth putting in, as the ones there are too wild.

I think my mail wasn't very clear ;-) My point was that we should continue
releasing new rules and removing broken ones (all based on discussions on
this list of course) in the 2.4 branch instead of creating a new 2.5 branch
everytime we have a bunch of new rules.

A new branch should be openend only if (big) new features are introduced
(eg. Bayes) or the interface has changed (spam_level_char=x). As the rules
are under fluent development, the user has to update quite regularly. But
currently he couldn't be shure if the new release will break anything in
his setup (like -F going away). So if we say "the branches are stable to
the outside and just improved under the surface but you have to watch out
when you update to a new minor version number", users and sysadmins could
be less reluctant to update.

All just IMHO :o)

This is not directly SpamAssassin related, but more of a general
dealing-with-SPAM issue.

What is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction?
There are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the 'MAIL
FROM' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think
most people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a "permanent" error. That
pretty much means, "Don't bother to try from that address again,
you'll get the same error." People often add cathartic messages to
accompany the 550 like, "Spammers must die."

But this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers
that you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to
get around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?
That is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but
then just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how
SpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP
transaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is
going fine and has no reason to try new methods.

Then there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code
indicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is
saying "mailbox does not exist." This would be in the hopes that some
spammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from
their lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can
lower the incidence.

So, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ of
the bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be
huge. Personally, I'm starting to think blackholes are the way to
go... But sending back that "Spammer die, die, die," or stock "Access
DEE-NIED!" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;)

I successfully installed spamassassin & razor to run system wide on my
Debian Woody server.

Briefly I
apt-get installed spamassassin razor and libmilter-dev,

downloaded spamass-milter-0.1.2.tar.gz from http://www.milter.org,
ungzipped and untarred the file into /etc/mail,

followed the directions in /etc/mail/spamass-milter-0.1.2/README to
compile the milter, install the rc scripts, and edit and update
sendmail.mc

changed /etc/default/spamassassin to set spamassassin to daemon mode.

verified that spamassassin was running by tailing /var/log/mail.log

Woody/stable has SA 2.20
Woody/unstable has SA 2.41

I'm running the stable source live right now and it is working very
well.

If you want unstable change /etc/apt/sources.list, substituting
"unstable" for "stable",
Run apt-get update
Install the unstable versions
Change /etc/apt/sources.list
Run apt-get update

Subject: [SAtalk] Debianized Packages for SA 2.3+

Im currently using woody.

Is there a debianized package for SA on Woody, or at least somewhere I
can download from? Its been soo long that I haven't compiled stuff, that
Im sort of shy to try again. =)

Good to hear it's not just me. Mind telling me how you set PERL5LIB
specificly? I've tried a few things (setenv in the shell, as well as
$PERL5LIB == ...inside the Makefile.PL, even on the perl command
line..) with no success.

- Presuming your run Bash :
Note the directory lists
# perl -e 'map { print "$_\n" } @INC'
Then set up the Shell variable PERL5LIB variable (and put it in some .bashrc
for future use)
# export PERL5LIB="directory1:directory2:directory3:directory4"
Then try to install the software

PERL5LIB is explained perlrun(1) : do

Ever since I set defang_mime 0 all spam that contains HTML has a badly

Funny, I was in the middle of composing the same message when I saw yours.

It would be nice if it sees a header like:
Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

and defang_mime is 0, it could wrap the report with for ease
of reading?

And the same sort of problem seems to occur with base64 encoded messages.
The report is placed inside of the mime boundary:
------=_NextPart_000_00B7_31E64A2B.B8441E37
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Should this not go above (probably in it's own mime section,) to make sure
that the attachments don't get destroyed?

1. These messages could end up being falsely (or incorrectly) reported
to Razor, DCC, Pyzor, etc. Certain RBLs too. I don't think the
results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way,
shape, or form when running over a public corpus.

I'll note that in the README.

2. These messages could also be submitted (more than once) to projects
like SpamAssassin that rely on filtering results submission for GA
tuning and development.
The second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsa
signature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format used
by SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 or
SHA-1 of each file).

OK; maybe rewriting the message-ids will help here, that should allow
us to pick them out. I'll do that.

3. Spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off
filters. And, of course, there's always progression in technology
(by both spammers and non-spammers).
The third problem doesn't really worry me.

nah, me neither.

These problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are unique
to spam filtering. Compression corpuses and other performance-related
corpuses have their own set of problems, of course.

In other words, I don't think there's any replacement for having
multiple independent corpuses. Finding better ways to distribute
testing and collate results seems like a more viable long-term solution
(and I'm glad we're working on exactly that for SpamAssassin). If
you're going to seriously work on filter development, building a corpus
of 10000-50000 messages (half spam/half non-spam) is not really that
much work. If you don't get enough spam, creating multi-technique
spamtraps (web, usenet, replying to spam) is pretty easy. And who
doesn't get thousands of non-spam every week? ;-)

Yep. The primary reason I released this, was to provide a good, big
corpus for academic testing of filter systems; it allows results to
be compared between filters using a known corpus.

For SpamAssassin development, everyone has to maintain their own corpus.

If you didn't add it when compile would be one way. Another would be to

Is there an easy way to tell if Milter is compiled in?

To see all the options compiled into (and version of) sendmail, try the
following line:

echo \$Z | /path/to/sendmail -bt -d0

Does this fork+exec a perl interpreter for every incoming mail? If so, I
reckon your mailer is vulerable to a DoS attack without too much effort...
The real question is: is there a way to run razor without this overhead?
Even some sort of razord you could talk to over a unix socket would do.
Until I can find one, I cannot spare the resources to run razor at all :(

I'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail
problem. Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning
FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my
wife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few other
services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we
get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On
occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a
reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in
which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see
over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an
occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.

I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated
with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,
to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor
files. So I have just added "-home /etc/razor" as an argument. I
haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether
this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This
paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph
above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)

At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email
processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes? Is there,
perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?

Any ideas would be welcome.

Thanks,
Joe

See your /etc/sendmail.cf file, there are a number of methods for limiting
the number of concurrent sendmail processes, either by load average (I'm
sure), or concurrency (I think)... I use sendmail anymore (I use qmail) but
I'm sure that if you look in the config file, you will see what you need...

The following was personal correspondence between two people. I can't
fathom how Razor thinks it is spam:

We are struggling with the decisions related to wether or not to
go ahead with our plans to purchase an OCR and forms
scanning solution.

An outside consultant mentioned that he had heard that not to
long ago you folks were considering implementing OCR
technology to reduce data entry costs and improve efficiency.
If you could let us know if you did move foreward with any
plans in that direction it would be of great help to us. May I ask
what initialy prompted you to consider OCR? Did you decide it
could help your compamy? What software did you go with?
Would you recomend we take a look at it?
At present we are still planning to continue our research until
we decide which OCR system best suits our needs, then
implement it quickly.

If you are just starting to consider this
technology feel free to stay in touch. We will let you know what
we decide on and if it works for us.

If you cannot advise on this please forward this E-mail to the
proper individual in your company who might be able to help with
this.
Thanks,
Jay

Oh, I was serious. I'm awful with perl/etc. I just think the HTML graph that
was created was pretty neat and I wish I could do something like that. :-)

I can't tell if you are serious or joking. I have a custom perl based
spam
blocking framework that uses plug-ins to block spam. I test each message
with every plug-in and keep the stats in a mysql database, which are what
you see below.

Sorry about the html, for those of you still using elm or other

clients. I don't have time to post it as text.

The "Spam Count" is the total of all spam detected by the various
filters.

Jammed is a custom phrase ranking system.
Razored is Razor v2.
Bayesian filter is based off of Paul Graham's work (statistical
probability), using a corpus of 4000 non-spam and 2000 spam messages.

Hi,

Newbie (to the list) question; I've been working on porting the code to
run under Perl on Windows. The changes are fairly minor and can be made
to interoperate with the current code. How would one best go about
getting those changes merged in (better question, would there be
interest in such a version and getting those changes merged in)?

Bill

I found a nice little Perl script for this purpose called rotate, which
makes the process of rotating log files very simple. If there's an
official source for this script, I couldn't find it. (My hosting
provider, pair.com, has it installed, and that's where I found it.)
However, redistribution appears to be allowed, so I've attached it.

Good luck...

Thanks for the post there, it answered all my questions about
spamassassin/razor interaction.

Now for a razor question:

I'm worried about having a server full of razor-agent.log files which keep
on growing. Is it possible to configure razor log via SYSLOG to make it
easy to rotate logs? Searching through the man pages didn't turn anything
up... Otherwise I'll have to write a script to go through each user's home
directory looking for razor-agent.log files to rotate periodically.

Thanks for the script. It also appears that the standard logrotate tools

wildcards when rotating files so something like
/home/*/.razor/razor-agent.log can be specified...

Thanks for the post there, it answered all my questions about
spamassassin/razor interaction.

Now for a razor question:

I'm worried about having a server full of razor-agent.log files which keep
on growing. Is it possible to configure razor log via SYSLOG to make it
easy to rotate logs? Searching through the man pages didn't turn anything
up... Otherwise I'll have to write a script to go through each user's home
directory looking for razor-agent.log files to rotate periodically.

Thanks,
Dave

Shouldn't there be a w, somewhere in tehre? Simply setting group and
owner to read and execute won't alleviate a write problem.

This is my first time running Razor, heard a lot of good things about it so
I thought I'd give it a shot. I also run SpamAssassin so I'd like to
integrate the two.

I'm not sure if this problem is with SpamAssassin or Razor, so I though I'd
shoot the message here first

With a freshly installed SpamAssassin 2.41 and Razor 2.14 I'm seeing these
messages spit out from spamd:

razor2 check skipped: No such file or directory Can't call method "log" on
unblessed reference at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm
line 211, line 75.

Any ideas? razor seems to run correctly over the command line.

It looks like you're running via procmail -- what are the permissions
on procmail? "Insecure dependency" screams "I'm in taint mode!", which
is a typical problem when procmail is setuid/setgid (the permissions
should be 755).

If this is in fact the problem, an easy solution is to put "DROPPRIVS=yes"
in the procmailrc. :)

With a freshly installed SpamAssassin 2.41 and Razor 2.14 I'm seeing these
messages spit out from spamd:

razor2 check skipped: No such file or directory Can't call method "log" on

line 211, line 75.

Any ideas? razor seems to run correctly over the command line.

Thanks,

It looks like you're running via procmail -- what are the permissions
on procmail? "Insecure dependency" screams "I'm in taint mode!", which
is a typical problem when procmail is setuid/setgid (the permissions
should be 755).

If this is in fact the problem, an easy solution is to put "DROPPRIVS=3Dyes"
in the procmailrc. :)

Forgive me for being a partially stupid end-user of this fantastic
spam fighting software.

I was looking at my spamd debug output today, and noticed that it ran
through Razor2 stuff, and then it ran through dccproc, and then it tried to
go through old Razor1 stuff. I'm assuming (and please correct me if I'm
wrong) that Razor1 is out dated and was to be replaced entirely by Razor2.

If that's the case, can someone please point me to something that explains
how to remove Razor1 from my system? I don't see a point in envoking it.
Especially when it appears to error out on me.

debug: Razor1 is available
debug: entering helper-app run mode
debug: Razor Agents 1.19, protocol version 2.
debug: 170803 seconds before closest server discovery
debug: Agent terminated
Problem while trying to load Razor1: Permission denied at
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm line 288.
debug: leaving helper-app run mode

Thanks!

No as a answer to this FAQ, would the recommended answer be to

a) chmod 755 /usr/bin/procmail

or

b) add DROPPRIVS=yes to /etc/procmailrc

or

c) all of the above

I ask because I just did B, and my procmail is still:
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root mail 67988 Jul 24 15:43 /usr/bin/procmail
But things seem to be working, so far..

I just set up razor and spamassassin, but I keep getting this error in my
mail log file

razor2 check skipped: No such file or directory Can't call method "log" on
unblessed reference at
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm line 212.

I have looked through the archived list and the only thing I have seen
about this error is a possible permission problem on the log file.
I did what it said in the archives, basically change the permission on the
file but its still no go.

Any other help would be appreciated, maybe I'm missing something.

Yeah, the answer isn't here in this list, it's on the spamassassin-users

Hint: Add -H to the spamd startup flags using the latest version of
spamassassin.

It's a permissions issue on the razor log file. SpamAssassin runs setuid
to the user to whom mail is being delivered.

You'll need to make the razor log file world writable.

Hey Folks

I know this question gets asked a lot, but I haven't seen an answer lately.

Any idea when a user will be able to view his own trust rating? What are
the plans for this? Will it be built into the client, web based, emailed
to you nightly? If you could share your brainstorming on the subject, I
would greatly appreciate it.

I have a spamd/spamc/razor/dcc setup.

My razor logs are full of:

Sep 10 09:48:48.411339 check[10200]: [ 1] [bootup] Logging initiated
LogDebugLevel=3 to file:/home/omega13/.razor/razor-agent.log
Sep 10 09:48:49.391309 check[10200]: [ 3] mail 1 is not known spam.

The problem is that all the entries show "is not known spam" I can't believe
I'm that lucky. So, how do I test to see that my razor installation is
working properly. I've been up to my ears in documentation for the past few
days, so, if the reference is easy, just point me to it. Otherwise a brief
hint on how to, would be appreciated.

Interesting. I just upgraded to razor-agents 2.14 yesterday, ran
razor-admin -register. I to am seeing that I'm not getting any positives
from razor. Including the sample-spam.txt's from spamassassin 2.41, 2.31,

Any suggestions? thanks.

I'm taking all my razored mail today and calling any 1-800 numbers I can
find. I say "Hi, I'm calling everyone that spammed me today to raise their
cost of doing business. You have a great day!" I'm told I should do it
from a pay phone, so it costs them 50 cents per call. If more people did
this, we could tie up their phone lines and cost them so much money they
could never make spam work.

Also fun is the simple "Die Spammer Die!"

Hi,

Is it possible to use razor without filtering empty mails as spamm?
An mail with an attachment is considered spamm. Is this normal?
Or I mysqlf like to send emails to myself where all important is said in
subject and body is empty (for remaining smth).

Thanks,

Before or after I whitelisted all the legit mailing lists that Razor is
tagging? I had one false positive in the last four days. Razor tagged some
guys person-to-person message because he used an ostrich-in-your-face jpeg
that is probably pretty popular on the net, and -lm 4 means any single
attachment in a message that is razored, razors the whole message, if I
understand it correctly.

Razor folks: is -lm documented anywhere? BTW, I notice all my *.conf
files in ~/.razor use "lm = 4" by default anyway.

No, I am not keeping official tally of false positives. I need to write a
html interface to do it, and then it would be easy. I imagine you want
false positive rate per filter. I will work on it tomorrow, and maybe in a
week I will have some stats for false positives.

Yeah, that'd be cool -- much appreciated! comparing text classifiers
like spam filters, without tracking FPs, is not good. After all, "cat >
/dev/null" gets a 100% hit rate, but without the FP rate figure of, let's
say 90%, you'd never know it was a bad thing to do ;)

Gary Funck [2002-09-18 13:57:00 -0700]:
In my experience, there are spam messages that sneak past Spam Assassin,
that Razor will pick up. Those are the ones that I'm calling "marginal".
Basically, I'm hoping that "the collective" of Razor users make a better
judge of spam than any single program like SA can, and therefore I can
benefit from their judgement and get more extensive spam filtering. I've
seen examples of this already, where SA doesn't score the spam high enough
to bounce it, but Razor does.

I think perhaps you missed the fact that SA scores are adjustable. If
you want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this
in your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.

score RAZOR_CHECK 10

The default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5.
Therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA
then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5
would be sufficient.

If you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient.
Otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once
for SA and once again afterward. If you really want to run Razor
individually then you should set the 'score RAZOR_CHECK 0' so that SA
won't do it and avoid the double network hit.

However, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has
been the history of false positive reports in the razor database. The
current score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam.
But for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold.
Razor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide
of use as Razor1.

I suggest that you use a normal user to start. Once you are familiar
enough with razor and understand how it works, try the complex things
like integration with the MTA and the like.

OK, but do I have to launch that command as "root" or what?

Thank you

Using -lm 4 is yielding an extra 20% a day, but it gets false positives
where it shouldn't.

Such as an email with a Word doc and the signature below. After looking at
the Word doc, directions to the sender's cabin, I am convinced it marked the
body, which contains no next except the "IncrediMail advertisment"
signature, as spam.

So I have to turn off -lm 4. Razor has been getting other strange emails it
shouldn't with -lm 4 on.

See the incredimail ad signature I am talking about below:

Depends on how you want to use it.

The default setup of running it from procmail works just fine, as long as
you remember to go into your postfix/main.cf file, and tell it to use
procmail instead of the internal delivery agent.

Here is my recipe for Maildrop:

# Vipul's Razor check
#
log `/usr/bin/razor-check`
log "razor-check = $RETURNCODE"
if ( $RETURNCODE == 0 )
{
xfilter "reformail -a'X-Razor: SPAM'"
log "SPAM caught by Vipul's Razor"
to "$FOLDERS/.SPAM/"
}

I used this with Razor version 1. I'm not sure if it was ever used
with Razor2. I am now using SpamAssassin w/ Razor2. You may wish to
remove the log statements once running.

I use both. SpamAssassin (SA) catches things that Razor does not. There
were enough false positives with Razor that I do not trust it alone.
After whitelisting all the newsletters I receive, SA w/ Razor2 does a
very good job.

Hi.

I just finished installing and getting running maildrop with my virtual
users. I was thinking to set up razor with maildrop as my first test of
its filtering capabilities..

I have seen documentation out there for procmail, but is there similar
documentation for integrating maildrop with razor?

Separately, it looks like many people use spamassassin with razor. If I
am using razor2, is there still an advantage to this?

Thanks in advance.

What is the maildrop recipe you use with spamassassin? I was trying to
set mine up but I am running into a few difficulties.

I think I will try spamassassin first and see how it goes, and then
perhaps fold in razor2... is it easy to fold in?

I received a spam email that had apparently forged the From header with
my own email address. After reviewing the message I forwarded it with
the rest of a batch of spam ti the database with razor-report. Now of,
course, my own email address is listed int he Razor database. How do I
go about getting it removed.

I have seen this ploy (forged From headers) several time since then.
Perhaps the razor-report need to detect this and emit a warning.

Hi Vipul,

I reckon if the "unwritable log file" error condition could be caught by
Razor and handled gracefully (logging to syslog or /dev/null), it'd be a
great help.

As it stands, if the log file is unwritable, the razor check falls over
entirely as the constructor returns undef (unblessed reference = 'die'
error in perl).

Try installing the latest Perl (at least 5.6.1) port on Freebsd and make
sure you set the system to use perl from ports (i.e. in the
ports/lang/perl5/files directory run ./use.perl port. Reinstall the relevant
perl modules needed by razor and try again.

I noticed a drop in checks, and did some tests. If I move truth up in
my catalog list, a check comes back postive, but if I move fire up in
the list, then I don't get the positive check back. It's almost like
it's not syncing up with Hubris which is the one my reports are getting
sent to.

I recently brought up a new system - SuSe 7.3 and I am running
spamassassin and procmail, which work fine.

I tried bringing up razor (2.14) but I am not able to get the SDK to
install and razor reports missing modules. They appear to be there. I
followed the installation directions. There appears to be an endless list
of errors. Any ideas on what to do or where to start?

Error 230 occurs when you report a signature, but the server doesn't

I'm still seeing razor reporting bomb out with a small variety of messages.
Would reinitializing something here help, or does razor do that as needed
anyway, and this just reflects trouble at the servers?

Also, since these are reports I'm making from within Mutt, it's annoying
that the error messages garble the X window a bit. If there's nothing
constructive to do about razor failing, can I at least turn off the failure
messages? One way or the other I'd rather not see them.

Hello,

I have just spoken with an UUnet technician at 11:23 PDT and he was unable
to provide me with any new information regarding the outage. He did
confirm that problems had spread beyond the east coast and are now seen
nationwide through out their network. They are currently working with
their hardware vendor to try and isolate the issue.

A large number of Internap's connections to UUnet remain shutdown and
traffic is being routed over alternate providers. The scale of this
outage is causing a large number of peering points with UUnet and other
providers to be flooded due to the large traffic shifts.

If you have problems reaching specific sites please send an email to
noc@internap.com containing a traceroute and source/destination IP
addresses and we will investigate. If it is possible will will attempt to
move specific prefixes onto an alternate provider leaving an Internap PNAP
if that will provide better performance.

Regards,
Andrew

This is happening due to insufficient write access to the
"razor-agent.log" file. I was getting the same error, but
only as a non-root user. As a quick workaround, you can do
"chmod go+w razor-agent.log".

In Agent.pm, when then the Logger object is created, it
doesn't check whether the logfile is writable by the current
user. Then, when a write attempt is made, it bails out with
the "unblessed reference" error.

Hope that helps,
Michael

I just noticed the following log entries in my syslog with the latest
Spamassassin CVS (set up using spamc/spamd) and razor-agents 2.14:

Jul 26 17:30:09 timmy spamd[54928]: razor2 check skipped: No such file or
directory Can't call method "log" on unblessed reference at
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm line 211,
line 25.

I saw this after checking if my upgrade from razor-agents 2.12 to 2.14 went
okay, but the problem is still there after downgrading back to 2.12. I
don't really know when this started happening, :-/

Any ideas on the problem?

razor-agents 2.14 needs all parts to be spam to make a positive decision
(though this will change with the next release), so it couldn't have been
a background. Could you send me the debug log?

Using Razor2 via SpamAssasin.

System is Solaris 2.7, with qmail. Spamassassin run via user's procmail.
All users who use SA have run razor-register.

Razor2 is failing, and I can't find anything in the limited docs or on
google on it,
and I'm hoping someone can help.

The error (which doesn't prevent SA from working) is:

Oct 2 06:38:22 sancho2 qmail: 1033565902.186041 delivery 4588: success:

I've been testing Razor, invoked from sendmail/procmail and so far it
seems pretty copacetic. Last night's spam to the list provided a good test
- the spam itself as well as several of the responses were flagged, as
other list members reported.

This morning I piped the messages out from pine, being careful to use the
RAW mode, to razor-check -d. None of the messages come back as spam, even
the spam. Since folks revoked the false positives, I understand why they
would not come up, but not the spam itself, unless that also was revoked.

Is this spam just a bad one to test against, or is there some setting in
pine or razor that I am missing?

Are you using Spamassassin on the input side? I've just changed my sendmail installation and am looking for the 'proper' way to pass it through there, systemwide, before accepting it and sending it to the users. It's kinda problematic to set up procmail scripts for every user, when the user's home directories are NFS mounted....and the source is on my own machine, on which I try new things. (And it's the only machine with the drivespace...)

I've not used Spamassassin on the KISS principle. I just have procmail
adding an X-header and optionally modifying the Subject if razor-check
comes back positive.

I am somewhat puzzled by a phone call I (or rather the CIO at the ISP for
whom I work) received from an individual claiming to represent Cloudmark.
The gist of the call was that since we were using razor and checking our
mail against the razor servers and that since those servers contain
information proprietary to Cloudmark, we would [in the near future?] be
required to begin paying Cloudmark/spamnet $1.00/user per year. I was
wondering if anyone else has received such a call?

I am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users
with the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor or
whether the open source/community aspect of the razor project is going by
the wayside in lieu of a strictly commercial approach (ala brightmail and
the likes).

Hi,

I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
changes to its own "redo" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
current disk image for that specific virtual machine.

This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
honeypots mailing list)
http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html

Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.

The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.

When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a "delta" or
"redo" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)

Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
no) downtime.

Thanks for any opinions,
Ben

This sounds really feasible but I may be totaly wrong. I may also be wrong

What do you think ?

That's similar to using hard-locks (either the old parallel, or the new
usb).

The problem is that that piece of hardware is trustworthy, but the rest of
the PC isn't, so a cracker just needs to simulate the lock/smart card, or
peek at the executable after the lock has been deactivated.

Consciousness: that annoying time between naps.

I did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 years
ago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don't
recall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image
of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is
intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is
not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary
if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.
There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the
early 1980s if not before.

A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement
snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information
must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you
wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly
adequate.

It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed
and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)
must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,
or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS
lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not
tried it on extf3 or reiser.)

BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of
writing to RAID4 or RAID5...
I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense
to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do
not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and
there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk
may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault
recovery
and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?

the only way to insure a safe key is to use all the storage space in the
universe. too big to decrypt.

my point is there will never be a "safe" key. what I would consider is how
long does the data need to be protected. if you need to protect the data for
longer than 6 months, do not release it to the public. if you are trying to
stop the general public (your customer) from coping the data then use what
is available on the market. If you want to stop the bootleggers do not
release the data to the public.

I have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked. the act of unlocking
the key gives away it's secret.

the tougher the lock the more pissed-off your customers will be. take MS-XP
for example. only the home user is forced to register. think of the
nightmare if business had to register every copy. how many times have we
needed to reinstall our laptop OS? notice the amount of Mac's sold after the
XP release. these where mostly home users that converted to Mac OS.

the new Audio CD's that have digital copy protection so not play on my
computer. does this stop me from copying the CD? no. however it does make me
return them and get my money back.

the more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked.

Simple approxmation to this: make /usr a separate partion, and mount it=

read-only:
=20
* The good news: attackers that want to trojan your software have to
reboot, at least.
* The bad news: administrators that want to update your software
have to reboot, at least.

No reboot is required, you just need to remount it:

# mount -o remount,rw /usr

This requires root access, but presumably /usr is safe from non-root
users anyway.

Only way to disable this is to have the kernel compiled with something
that compartmentalizes capabilities (LIDS/etc on Linux for example) or to
remove CAP_SYS_ADMIN with lcap, which would definately require a reboot,
and possibly break some other functionatily to boot. (Pun intended. My
apologies.)

Subject: Re: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from
attacks

I did my dissertation work in this area (Optimistic Computing) and so was
interested in applying it to the security problem. Unfortunately, you hit a
bunch of problems:

a.. When can you "commit" a state as being "good"? You can't run from
a
redo log forever; the performance and storage penalties accumulate. Even
log
structured file systems garbage collect eventually. So you have to commit
sometime. The problem is that if you commit too eagerly, you might commit
corrupted state. If you commit too conservatively, you eat performance and
storage penalties.
b.. What do you do if you discover that there is corrupted state in the
*middle* of your redo log, and you want some of the critical state that
comes after it? You need some way to dig the corruption out of the middle
and save the rest. My dissertation solves this problem, but you have to
re-write everything in my programming language :)
. c.. Just doing this at all imposes substantial performance penalties. I
love VMWare, and use it every day (the best $200 I ever spent on software)
.but it is not very fast.

My proposed solution to the first two problems you mention is to be less
ambitious. The idea is that you *never* commit - instead, you simply revert
to base state on reboot. Obviously, you can't do this with partitions that
accrue important state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data.
But in your typical web application, most partitions do not accrue important
state. For example, your typical web server or application server could have
their entire state reset back to a known base state during each reboot
without harm.
The advantage of being less ambitious is that we have a quick and easy way
to frustrate certain attacks without rewriting all of our software or
spending lots of money on additional application-specific coding.

The first two problems you describe only occur if we become more ambitious
and try to apply these same techniques to, for example, the database table
partitions, where state changes remain important across reboots. That would
certainly be a nice touch! But as you point out, many problems would have to
be addressed first, and the hardest of these can not be abstracted away from
the particular application. Not the least of these is the problem of writing
heuristics for delineating good from malevolent state. That task is roughly
analogous to what antiviral software authors do for a living, only this work
could not be shared across many different systems as it would be specific to
a paritcular application.

The third problem you mention - performance penalty - is an argument for
doing this in hardware, much like hardware raid. Another argument for doing
this in hardware is hack resistance. Changing the base instance should
require physical access to the console, e.g. by requiring that you first
flip a physical switch on your RAID hardware or modify a bios setting. If
the base image can be modified remotely or by software, then you have to
worry about whether an implementation flaw might permit a cracker to modify
the base image remotely.

currently capturing a stream coming into python.org, and I hope we can get a
more modern, and cleaner, test set out of that.

Not yet -- still working on the required config changes. But I have a
cunning plan...

But if that stream contains
any private email, it may not be ethically possible to make that available.

It will! Part of my cunning plan involves something like this:

if folder == "accepted": # ie. not suspected junk mail
if (len(recipients) == 1 and
recipients[0] in ("guido@python.org", "barry@python.org", ...)):
folder = "personal"

If you (and Guido, Barry, et. al.) prefer, I could change that last
statement to "folder = None", so the mail won't be saved at all. I
*might* also add a "and sender doesn't look like -bounce-*, -request,
-admin, ..." clause to that if statement.

Can you think of anyplace to get a large, shareable ham sample apart from a
public mailing list? Everyone's eager to share their spam, but spam is so
much alike in so many ways that's the easy half of the data collection
problem.

I believe the SpamAssassin maintainers have a scheme whereby the corpus
of non-spam is distributed, ie. several people have bodies of non-spam
that they use for collectively evolving the SA score set. If that
sounds vague, it matches my level of understanding.

As an aside: one of the best ways to dodge SpamAssassin is by having an
In-Reply-To header. Most list traffic should meet this criterion.

Alternately, I can whitelist mail to spambayes@python.org -- that'll
work until spammers get ahold of the list address, which usually seems
to take a few months.

Perhaps more useful would be if Tim could check in the pickle(s?)
generated by one of his training runs, so that others can see how
Tim's training data performs against their own corpora. This could
also be the starting point for a self-contained distribution (you've
got to start with *something*, and training with python-list data

I don't care if the mail is foldered on python.org, but personal
messages regardless of who they're for, shouldn't be part of the
public spambayes repository unless specifically approved by both the
recipient and sender.

Note also that we are much more liberal about python.org/zope.org
mailing list traffic than most folks. Read list-managers for any
length of time and you'll find that there are a lot of people who
assert strict copyright over their collections, are very protective of
their traffic, and got really pissed when gmane just started
gatewaying their messages without asking.

Which might be an appropriate for their lists, but not for ours (don't
think I'm suggesting we do the same -- I /like/ our laissez-faire
approach).

But for personal email, we should be more careful.
-Barry
Quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm, I'd like to
think about deployment.

Eventually, individuals and postmasters should be able to download a
spambayes software distribution, answer a few configuration questions
about their mail setup, training and false positives, and install it
as a filter.

A more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can
easily be used by individuals (since we're more likely to find
individuals willing to risk this than postmasters).

There are many ways to do this. Some ideas:

- A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server. You
configure it by telling it about your real pop servers. You then
point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost. When it
receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads
your mail, and gives you only the non-spam. To train it, you'd only
need to send it the false negatives somehow; it can assume that
anything is ham that you don't say is spam within 48 hours.

- A server with a custom protocol that you send a copy of a message
and that answers "spam" or "ham". Then you have a little program
that is invoked e.g. by procmail that talks to the server. (The
server exists so that it doesn't have to load the pickle with the
scoring database for each message. I don't know how big that pickle
would be, maybe loading it each time is fine. Or maybe
marshalling.)

- Your idea here.

Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?

Do you have a dialup or something more modern ?

Much more modern: a cable modem with a small upload rate cap. There's a
reason the less modern uncapped @Home went out of business .

134MB of messages zipped would probably compress pretty well - under 50MB
I'd guess with all the similarity in the headers and such. You could zip
each of the 10 sets individually and upload them somewhere.

I suppose this could finish over the course of an afternoon. Now where's
"somewhere"? I expect we'll eventually collect several datasets;
SourceForge isn't a good place for it (they expect projects to distribute
relatively small code files, and complain if even those get big).

...
How about random sampling lots of public mailing lists via gmane or
something similar, manually cleaning it (distributing that load over a
number of people) and then relying on your clever code and your
rebalancing script to help further cleanse it?

What then are we training the classifier to do? Graham's scoring scheme is
based on an assumption that the ham-vs-spam task is *easy*, and half of that
is due to that the ham has a lot in common. It was an experiment to apply
his scheme to all the comp.lang.python traffic, which is a lot broader than
he had in mind (c.l.py has long had a generous definition of "on topic"
). I don't expect good things to come of making it ever broader,
*unless* your goal is to investigate just how broad it can be made before it
breaks down.

The "problem" with the ham is it tends to be much more tied to one person
(not just intimate, but unique) than the spam.

Which is "a feature" from Graham's POV: the more clues, the better this
"smoking guns only" approach should work.

I save all incoming email for ten days (gzipped mbox format) before it
rolls
over and disappears. At any one time I think I have about 8,000-10,000
messages. Most of it isn't terribly personal (which I would cull before
passing along anyway) and much of it is machine-generated, so would be of
marginal use. Finally, it's all ham-n-spam mixed together. Do we call
that an omelette or a Denny's Grand Slam?

Unless you're volunteering to clean it, tag it, package it, and distribute
it, I'd call it irrelevant .

I've got a test set here that's the last 3 and a bit years email to
info@ekit.com and info@ekno.com - it's a really ugly set of 20,000+
messages, currently broken into 7,000 spam, 9,000 ham, 9,000 currently
unclassified. These addresses are all over the 70-some different
ekit/ekno/ISIConnect websites, so they get a LOT of spam.

As well as the usual spam, it also has customers complaining about
credit card charges, it has people interested in the service and
asking questions about long distance rates, &c &c &c. Lots and lots
of "commercial" speech, in other words. Stuff that SA gets pretty
badly wrong.

Can this corpus be shared? I suppose not.

I'm currently mangling it by feeding all parts (text, html, whatever
else :) into the filters, as well as both a selected number of headers
(to, from, content-type, x-mailer), and also a list of (header,
count_of_header). This is showing up some nice stuff - e.g. the
X-uidl that stoopid spammers blindly copy into their messages.

If we ever have a shared corpus, an easy refactoring of timtest
should allow to plug in different tokenizers. I've only made three changes
to Graham's algorithm so far (well, I've made dozens -- only three survived
testing as proven winners), all the rest has been refining the tokenization
to provide better clues.

I did have Received in there, but it's out for the moment, as it causes
rates to drop.

That's ambiguous. Accuracy rates or error rates, ham or spam rates?

I'm also stripping out HTML tags, except for href="" and src="" - there's
so so much goodness in them (note that I'm only keeping the contents of
the attributes).

Mining embedded http/https/ftp thingies cut the false negative rate in half
in my tests (not keying off href, just scanning for anything that "looked
like" one); that was the single biggest f-n improvement I've seen. It
didn't change the false positive rate. So you know whether src added
additional power, or did you do both at once?

Dunno about the other tools, but SpamAssassin is a breeze to incorporate
into a procmail environment. Lots of people use it in many other ways. For
performance reasons, many people run a spamd process and then invoke a small
C program called spamc which shoots the message over to spamd and passes the
result back out. I think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fast
enough to not require such tricks (though I would consider changing the
pickle to an anydbm file).

Basic procmail usage goes something like this:

:0fw
| spamassassin -P

:0
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
$SPAM

Which just says, "Run spamassassin -P reinjecting its output into the
processing stream. If the resulting mail has a header which begins
"X-Spam-Status: Yes", toss it into the folder indicated by the variable
$SPAM.

SpamAssassin also adds other headers as well, which give you more detail
about how its tests fared. I'd like to see spambayes operate in at least
this way: do its thing then return a message to stdout with a modified set
of headers which further processing downstream can key on.

OK, here's a refinement. Assuming very little spam comes through, we
only need to pick a small percentage of ham received as new training
ham to match the new training spam. The program could randomly select
a sufficient number of saved non-spam msgs and ask the user to
validate this selection. You could do this once a day or week (config
parameter).

The advantage of using a kitchen sink (umm, make that highly programmable)
editor+email package like Emacs+VM is that you can twiddle your key bindings
and write a little ELisp (or Pymacs) glue to toss messages in the right
direction (spam or ham). For this, spambayes would have to operate in an
incremental fashion when fed a single ham or spam message.

Writing an IMAP server is a non-trivial task. The specification is huge
and clients do all kinds of weird stuff. POP is very easy in
comparison. Perhaps you could forward messages to a special address or
save them in a special folder to mark them as false negatives.

Alternatively, perhaps there could be a separate protocol and client
that could be used to review additions to the training set. Each day a
few random spam and ham messages could be grabbed as candidates.
Someone would periodically startup the client, review the candidates,
reclassify or remove any messages they don't like and add them to the

I think people will be much more motivated to report spam than ham. I
like the general approach that copies of random messages will be
sequestered for some period of time before they're assumed to be ham.
Matched with a simple spam reporting scheme, this could keep the
training up to date with little effort. I've sketched out an approach
a listserver like Mailman could do along these lines and if I get some
free time I'll hack something together.

I like the idea of a POP proxy which is classifying messages as
they're pulled from the server. The easiest way for such a beast to
be notified of spam might be to simply save the spam in a special
folder or file that the POP proxy would periodically consult.

My impression is that a pre-collected corpus would not fit most individuals
very well, but each individual (or group?) should collect their own corpus.

One problem that comes upp immediately: individuals are lazy.

If I currently get 50 spam and 50 ham a day, and I'll have to
press the 'delete' button once for each spam, I'll be happy
to press the 'spam' button instead. However, if in addition
have to press a 'ham' button for each ham, it starts to look
much less like a win to me. Add the time to install and setup
the whole machinery, and I'll just keep hitting delete.

The suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete
action, that adds a message to the ham corpus. I see two problems
with this: the ham will be a bit skewed; mail that I keep around
without deleting will not be counted. Secondly, if I by force of
habit happen to press the 'delete' key instead of the 'spam' key,
I'll end up with spam in the ham, anyways.

I would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham.

The obvious thing to do is to trigger on the 'spam' button,
and at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one
in the ham corpus, and simply remove them. To do this we
need a way to compare two word count histograms, to see
how similar they are. Any ideas ?

Also, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all.
If they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP),
false positives become the senders problem, to rewrite
to remove the spam smell.

In a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be much
smaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to be
slightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam from
the ham corpus. This should make it easier to keep it clean.

Having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus,
there's less need to worry about it getting there by mistake,
and we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus,
that didn't get deleted by the spam filtering.

It might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from
the spam corpus, in case of user ooops.

I guess MUA-level filtering is just a fallback for people who don't have
1) a burning, all-consuming hatred of junk mail, 2) root access to all
mail servers they rely on, and 3) the ability and inclination to install
an MTA with every bell and whistle tweaked to keep out junk mail.

Sure. But for most people, changing their company's or ISP's server
requires years of lobbying, while they have total and immediate
control over their own MUA.

That said, I agree that we should offer a good solution to
postmasters, and I trust that your ideas are right on the mark!

I think one step towards deployment is creating a re-usable tokenizer
for mail messages. The current codebase doesn't expose an easy-to-use
or easy-to-customize tokenizer.

The timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical
knowledge about how to parse mail messages, but the module wasn't
designed for re-use. I'd like to see a module that can take a single
message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one.

I'd like to see the tokenize by customizable, too. Tim had to exclude
some headers from his test data, because there were particular biases
in the test data. If other people have test data without those
biases, they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include
them or exclude others.

Jeremy

[Barry A. Warsaw, gives answers and asks questions]

Here's the code that produced the header tokens:

x2n = {}
for x in msg.keys():
x2n[x] = x2n.get(x, 0) + 1
for x in x2n.items():
yield "header:%s:%d" % x

Some responses:

0.01 19 3559 'header:X-Mailman-Version:1'
0.01 19 3559 'header:List-Id:1'
0.01 19 3557 'header:X-BeenThere:1'

These three are definitely MM artifacts, although the second one
/could/ be inserted by other list management software (it's described
in an RFC).

Since all the ham came from Mailman, and only 19 spam had it, it's quite
safe to assume then that I should ignore these for now.

0.01 0 3093 'header:Newsgroups:1'
0.01 0 3054 'header:Xref:1'
0.01 0 3053 'header:Path:1'

These aren't MM artifacts, but are byproducts of gating a message off
of an nntp feed. Some of the other NNTP-* headers are similar, but I
won't point them out below.

I should ignore these too then.

0.01 19 2668 'header:List-Unsubscribe:1'
0.01 19 2668 'header:List-Subscribe:1'
0.01 19 2668 'header:List-Post:1'
0.01 19 2668 'header:List-Help:1'
0.01 19 2668 'header:List-Archive:1'

RFC recommended generic listserve headers that MM injects.

Ditto.

So why do you get two entries for this one?

0.99 519 0 'header:Received:8'
0.99 466 1 'header:Received:7'

Read the code . The first line counts msgs that had 8 instances of a
'Received' header, and the second counts msgs that had 7 instances. I
expect this is a good clue! The more indirect the mail path, the more of
those thingies we'll see, and if you're posting from a spam trailer park in
Tasmania you may well need to travel thru more machines.

...
Note that header names are case insensitive, so this one's no
different than "MIME-Version:". Similarly other headers in your list.

Ignoring case here may or may not help; that's for experiment to decide.
It's plausible that case is significant, if, e.g., a particular spam mailing
package generates unusual case, or a particular clueless spammer
misconfigures his package.

0.02 65 3559 'header:Precedence:1'

Could be Mailman, or not. This header is supposed to tell other
automated software that this message was automated. E.g. a replybot
should ignore any message with a Precedence: {bulk|junk|list}.

Rule of thumb: if Mailman inserts a thing, I should ignore it. Or, better,
I should stop trying to out-think the flaws in the test data and get better
test data instead!

0.50 4 0 'header:2:1'

!?
...
0.50 0 2 'header:'

Heh?

I sucked out all the wordinfo keys that began with "header:". The last line
there was probably due to unrelated instances of the string "header:" in
message bodies. Harder to guess about the first line.

...
Some headers of course are totally unreliable as to their origin. I'm
thinking stuff like MIME-Version, Content-Type, To, From, etc, etc.
Everyone sticks those in.

The brilliance of Anthony's "just count them" scheme is that it requires no
thought, so can't be fooled . Header lines that are evenly
distributed across spam and ham will turn out to be worthless indicators
(prob near 0.5), so do no harm.

[Anthony Baxter]
The other thing on my todo list (probably tonight's tram ride home) is
to add all headers from non-text parts of multipart messages. If nothing
else, it'll pick up most virus email real quick.

See the checkin comments for timtest.py last night. Adding this code gave a
major reduction in the false negative rate:

def crack_content_xyz(msg):
x = msg.get_type()
if x is not None:
yield 'content-type:' + x.lower()

x = msg.get_param('type')
if x is not None:
yield 'content-type/type:' + x.lower()

So then, Guido van Rossum is all like:

Basic procmail usage goes something like this:

:0fw
| spamassassin -P

:0
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
$SPAM

Do you feel capable of writing such a tool? It doesn't look too hard.

Not to beat a dead horse, but that's exactly what my spamcan package
did. For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before I
knew about Tim & co's work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from
, but I'm not going
to work on it anymore.

I'm currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest's
booty-kicking tokenizer). I'll probably have something soon, like maybe
half an hour, and no, it's not too hard. The hard part is storing the
data somewhere. I don't want to use ZODB, as I'd like something a
person can just drop in with a default Python install. So anydbm is
looking like my best option.

I already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy's SpamOracle, which
does the same sort of thing. You call it from procmail, it adds a new
header, and then you can filter on that header. Really easy.

Here's how I envision this working. Everybody gets four new mailboxes:

train-eggs
train-spam
trained-eggs
trained-spam

You copy all your spam and eggs* into the "train-" boxes as you get it.
How frequently you do this would be up to you, but you'd get better
results if you did it more often, and you'd be wise to always copy over
anything which was misclassified. Then, every night, the spam fairy
swoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of
things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam. After she's
done, she moves your mail into the "trained-" folders.

This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read
their mail right off the server. I've spoken with some fellows at work
about Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports
appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.

Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail
client to bind the key "S" to "move to train-spam" and "H" to "move to
train-eggs". Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it'd
start showing up in mail clients. That's the "delete as spam" button
Paul Graham was talking about.

* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word "ham" as the
opposite of "spam", and they've been amazingly cool about the use of
their product name for things thus far. So I propose we start calling
non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as
"eggs".

[Jeremy Hylton]
I think one step towards deployment is creating a re-usable tokenizer
for mail messages. The current codebase doesn't expose an easy-to-use
or easy-to-customize tokenizer.

tokenize() couldn't be easier to use: it takes a string argument, and
produces a stream of tokens (whether via explicit list, or generator, or
tuple, or ... doesn't matter). All the tokenize() functions in GBayes.py
and timtest.py are freely interchangeable this way.

Note that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer would
do any good, or, if it would, in which ways customization could be helpful.
That's a research issue on which no work has been done.

The timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical
knowledge about how to parse mail messages, but the module wasn't
designed for re-use.

That's partly a failure of imagination . Splitting out all knowledge
of tokenization is just a large block cut-and-paste ... there, it's done.
Change the

from timtoken import tokenize

at the top to use any other tokenizer now. If you want to make it easier
still, feel free to check in something better.

I'd like to see a module that can take a single message or a collection of
messages and tokenize each one.

The Msg and MsgStream classes in timtest.py are a start at that, but it's
hard to do anything truly *useful* here when people use all sorts of
different physical representations for email msgs (mboxes in various
formats, one file per "folder", one file per msg, Skip's gzipped gimmick,
...). If you're a Python coder , you *should* find it very easy to
change the guts of Msg and MsgStream to handle your peculiar scheme.
Defining interfaces for these guys should be done.

I'd like to see the tokenize by customizable, too. Tim had to exclude
some headers from his test data, because there were particular biases
in the test data. If other people have test data without those
biases, they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include
them or exclude others.

This sounds like a bottomless pit to me, and there's no easier way to
customize than to edit the code. As README.txt still says, though, massive
refactoring would help. Hop to it!

I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all
Python platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.

Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikely
to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even
L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to
their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)

My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a
client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only
going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams
the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The
MUA accesses this "eThunk" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is
retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual
oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)
and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA
fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not
clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.

Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all
MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL's

IMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If
this is available, the "simple viewer" could be enhanced to support viewing
via folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would
use this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best
n-way classifier uses something called a "Support Vector Machine" (SVM)
which is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).

I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves
the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could
be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user's situation.

I see no reason to restrict the project to developing the classifier
and leave the deployment to others. Attempts at deployment in the
real world will surely provide additional feedback for the classifier.

On 06 September 2002, Tim Peters said:
Note that header names are case insensitive, so this one's no
different than "MIME-Version:". Similarly other headers in your list.

Ignoring case here may or may not help; that's for experiment to decide.
It's plausible that case is significant, if, e.g., a particular spam mailing
package generates unusual case, or a particular clueless spammer
misconfigures his package.

Case of headers is definitely helpful. SpamAssassin has a rule for it
-- if you have headers like "DATE" or "SUBJECT", you get a few more
points.

I see no reason why both approaches could and should not be used.
MTA level filtering would just need to use a different corpus, one that
would contain illegal or otherwise commonly unapproved material for the
group of people using that MTA. I'm sure that such an approach would
significantly reduce the mail traffic as a first step, without giving
false positives.

MUA corpus would then be personally trained -- although I'd like the
option of 'down-loadable' corpuses and merge functionality.

I don't know how big that pickle would be, maybe loading it each time
is fine. Or maybe marshalling.)

My tests train on about 7,000 msgs, and a binary pickle of the database is
approaching 10 million bytes. I haven't done anything to try to reduce its
size, and know of some specific problem areas (for example, doing character
5-grams of "long words" containing high-bit characters generates a lot of
database entries, and I suspect they're approximately worthless). OTOH,
adding in more headers will increase the size. So let's call it 10 meg
.

[Guido]
Takers? How is ESR's bogofilter packaged? SpamAssassin? The Perl
Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?

WRT the last, it's a small pile of Windows .exe files along with
cygwin1.dll. The .exes are cmdline programs. One is a POP3 proxy. If I
currently have an email server named, say, mail.comcast.net, with user name
timmy, then I change my email reader to say that my server is 127.0.0.1, and
that my user name on that server is mail.comcast.net:timmy. In that way the
proxy picks up both the real server and user names from what the mail reader
tells it the user name is.

This is an N-way classifier (like ifile that way), and "all it does" is
insert a

X-Text-Classification: one_of_the_class_names_you_picked

header into your email before passing it on to your mail reader. The user
then presumably fiddles their mail reader to look for such headers and "do
something about it" (and even Outlook can handle *that* much ).

The user is responsible for generating text files with appropriate examples
of each class of message, and for running the cmdline tools to train the
classifier.

You missed the part that said that spam is kept in the "eThunk" and was
viewable by a simple viewer for final disposition?

Of course, with Outbloat, you could fire up PythonWin and stuff the spam
into the Junk Email folder... but then you loose the ability to retrain on
the user classified ham/spam.

I don't know how big that pickle would be, maybe loading it each time

My tests train on about 7,000 msgs, and a binary pickle of the database is
approaching 10 million bytes.

My paltry 3000-message training set makes a 6.3MB (where 1MB=1e6 bytes)
pickle. hammie.py, which I just checked in, will optionally let you
write stuff out to a dbm file. With that same message base, the dbm
file weighs in at a hefty 21.4MB. It also takes longer to write:

Using a database:
real 8m24.741s
user 6m19.410s
sys 1m33.650s

Using a pickle:
real 1m39.824s
user 1m36.400s
sys 0m2.160s

This is on a PIII at 551.257MHz (I don't know what it's *supposed* to
be, 551.257 is what /proc/cpuinfo says).

For comparison, SpamOracle (currently the gold standard in my mind, at
least for speed) on the same data blazes along:

real 0m29.592s
user 0m28.050s
sys 0m1.180s

Its data file, which appears to be a marshalled hash, is 448KB.
However, it's compiled O'Caml and it uses a much simpler tokenizing
algorithm written with a lexical analyzer (ocamllex), so we'll never be
able to outperform it. It's something to keep in mind, though.

I don't have statistics yet for scanning unknown messages. (Actually, I
do, and the database blows the pickle out of the water, but it scores
every word with 0.00, so I'm not sure that's a fair test. ;) In any
case, 21MB per user is probably too large, and 10MB is questionable.

On the other hand, my pickle compressed very well with gzip, shrinking
down to 1.8MB.

[Tim]
My tests train on about 7,000 msgs, and a binary pickle of the database is
approaching 10 million bytes.

That shrinks to under 2 million bytes, though, if I delete all the WordInfo
records with spamprob exactly equal to UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB. Such records
aren't needed when scoring (an unknown word gets a made-up probability of
UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB). Such records are only needed for training; I've noted
before that a scoring-only database can be leaner.

In part the bloat is due to character 5-gram'ing, part due to that the
database is brand new so has never been cleaned via clearjunk(), and part
due to plain evil gremlins.

So then, Tim Peters is all like:

That's pretty good. I wonder how much better you could do by using some
custom pickler. I just checked my little dbm file and found a lot of
what I would call bloat:

import anydbm, hammie
d = hammie.PersistentGrahamBayes("ham.db")
db = anydbm.open("ham.db")
db["neale"], len(db["neale"])
('ccopy_reg\n_reconstructor\nq\x01(cclassifier\nWordInfo\nq\x02c__builtin__\nobject\nq\x03NtRq\x04(GA\xce\xbc{\xfd\x94\xbboK\x00K\x00K\x00G?\xe0\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00tb.', 106)
d.wordinfo["neale"], len(`d.wordinfo["neale"]`)
(WordInfo'(1031337979.16197, 0, 0, 0, 0.5)', 42)

Ignoring the fact that there are too many zeros in there, the pickled
version of that WordInfo object is over twice as large as the string
representation. So we could get a 50% decrease in size just by using
the string representation instead of the pickle, right?

Something about that logic seems wrong to me, but I can't see what it
is. Maybe pickling is good for heterogeneous data types, but every
value of our big dictionary is going to have the same type, so there's a
ton of redundancy. I guess that explains why it compressed so well.

The Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the
Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that
the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's
findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable:

By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to
third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers,
consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently
this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the
initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief
Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA
members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared
information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but
supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared
his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the
hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for "Hell Freezes
Over," which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no
more than a 10% "reserve" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had
held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years)

The T-Mobile Sidekick -- the first commercial implementation of the wonderful
Danger Hiptop PDA/phone -- is now onsale and the reviews are starting to
appear. As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I
really think I'm going to pick this up.

That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current
competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same
spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively
high- speed "GPRS" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious
surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice
time is another story -- more on that later.)

Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and
will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing
hybrids focus on "enterprise" customers -- the big businesses that are
supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most
clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their
own words, "Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to
34-year-old demographic."

I am that demographic! Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Steve[3]!_)

Date: 2002-10-03T01:31:51-05:00

Remember that saying from chaos theory about how when a butterfly flap its
wings, it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world? As
several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their
most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used
to be the #1 "mark"[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an
attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and
Google bombing[3].

Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked
site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the
linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for "go to hell"
[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for "talentless hack"[6]
no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were
previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on
whether Google is actively penalizing such sites.

Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have
caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on
medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far
as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work
putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive
with complaints and speculation:

- New update, pagerank death?[8]
- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9]
- Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10]

(Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no
longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely
false. Searching diveintomark.org for "gimli"[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]
, where "Gimli" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.)

Regardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly
degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam
sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so
good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing
frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're
tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It
didn't take long.

- Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a
hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems
unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and
Google absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address).
- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC
newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet
betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9.
- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent
site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself
(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I
didn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't
that helpful.

Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com
[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their
results for "eminem"[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the
beginning of the end of Google's reign?

Interview with cartoonist Ted Rall, who has traveled to South Asia recently,
and has tips on how to deal with bribe-hungry border guards and the like:

Rall: Now I realize that's just the way it is, and I know how to do it and
get away without paying a bribe, or paying something very modest. You have
to show them that you know the routine and that you know you don't have to
give them anything, and just have a low-key demeanor. But if you get angry,
that's just going to make things worse for you. You get out of your vehicle
and you walk up to them -- you don't try to avoid these guys; you don't try
to avoid their eyes -- you go up with a big smile, give them a big
handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say, "Hey, great to see you.
You're my new best friend for the next five minutes."

GROTH: Basically act like a used car salesman.

RALL: It's exactly like that! You always carry cigarettes. You offer them a
cigarette, and you say, "Hey, what's goin' on? How's it goin'? Great.
Here's my documents. How's the road?" Just small talk, because these guys
are bored. They're in the middle of nowhere, and you're sometimes the only
vehicle they've seen for many hours. They're often very drunk, so you just
have to be cool.

Rendering polygons is not as easy as it used to be, the reason being the vast
amount of different rendering techniques, methods and algorithms available. Not
only is choosing the right ones a problem, even worse, all that are selected
need to work together. There are some algorithms which simply do not work
together, and in that case, only one may be used whilt the other one needs to
be replaced witha more compatible method. This feature explores how Factor 5

All through October, Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is
hosting Cinemath, a mathematics film festival:

Permutations and Configurations: A Calculated Cinema

In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we explore films that have been
constructed using mathematical concepts both simple and complex- geometric
permutations, musical frameworks, even topography are among the strategies
that have been employed to compose and sequence film frames. Filmmakers
such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest
avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming
abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce
dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics
are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances
such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the
viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of
machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James
and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary
animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry
Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish
Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns,
while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously
calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton,
and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to
graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no
mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to
try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!

Rob "Pringles Can" Flickenger and others at the O'Reilly OS X con have tracked
down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network here -- every
20 or 30 seconds, you start getting "connection refused" messages from your
browser and other net-utilities.

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other
"promiscuous" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a "rejected" message.

So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa).
Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Don't do the

Dan Gillmor's column this week is all about Apple's burgeoning resistance to
the Hollywood onslaught on general-purpose computing:

Intel's doing it. Advanced Micro Devices is doing it. Microsoft is doing
it.

Apple Computer isn't.

What's Apple not doing? It's not -- at least so far -- moving toward an
anti-customer embrace with Hollywood's movie studios and the other members
of the powerful entertainment cartel.

From Ed Felten's "Freedom to Tinker" site, regarding the TinkleToonz Musical
Potty.:

This handy toilet training aid offers a "magical, musical land of potty
training," by playing a tune whenever liquid is deposited in it. Since it
plays digital audio, it qualifies for regulation as a "digital media
device" under the Hollings CBDTPA. If the CBDTPA passes, any newly
manufactured TinkleToonz Musical Potties will have to incorporate
government-approved copy protection technology.

I've been snowed under for the last four weeks, working on the FogBUGZ 3.0
Setup program.

For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield,
Windows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so
I ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer
than I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup
process should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the
wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already
made. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to
change where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and
everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the
Windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted
are ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result
is a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll
write more about what I learned.

One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to
have someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper
right hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently
infested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern.

*Mark:* The zine would be Jethro Bodine of "The Beverly Hillbillies" --
curious, neophilic, xenophilic, gleeful, and eager to adopt any new theory
or conspiracy as the absolute truth. The Blog would be Sherman from
"Peabody's Improbable History" -- a traveler of time and space in search of
beauty, truth, and the outre. I think Jethro bOING bOING and Sherman Boing
Boing would be great pals. Jethro would invite Sherman's dog, Mr. Peabody,
to go raccoon hunting with him, and Sherman would send Jethro 40 years into
the future to hang out at the Playboy Mansion.

Date: 2002-10-04T00:27:41-05:00

So I was researching the history of the tilde, because D told me that her
company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a
tilde in it. Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with
remarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that
reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be
honest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind
that. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the
tilde.

Every command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for "home
directory", and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username
will take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to
their Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can
trace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal
pages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to
have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more
commonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html
subdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point
your browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files
from that user's Sites directory within their home directory.

But I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde.

As with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in
this field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (
old habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene
Wallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a
tilde.

In fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be
used in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a
tilde in its URL.

Clearly, the tilde is underappreciated.

Digging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn
that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd
character called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if
indeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe,
to be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter.
The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the n
(now referenced in HTML as the named entity n), but somewhere along
the line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky
uses.

Digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for
#[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came
even later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^,
1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee
meeting, when it was proposed "as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease
SHARE". I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or
what this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991,
when the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8].

And now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of
yesterday called "Deja News", and kids today call "Google
Groups"), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William
Safire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially
pronounced "squiggle". This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary
[10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was
cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various
ASCII characters.

As early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem
[11].

In July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12].

In February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that
Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13].

As early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14].

As early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15].

In November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements
(history,tilde,job control)[16].

As early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed
in the APL-11 character set[18].

In April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying
bugs in csh).

In December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced "tilde"[20], prompting
this typographical pun[21].

And that's the earliest reference I can find.

So where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but
there are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the
tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for
"home directory"? When did it migrate into the world of web servers
to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web
sites? I don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing
my research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight.
May you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls.

So, d'ya remember that whole CSS debate that flared up about six months ago?
(Actually, it flares up continuously in various circles. In fact, I think it's
about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are
inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world.
But I digress.)

If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the
pro-CSS camp[1].

So anyway, d'ya remember that argument that went something like "you
should design with web standards and CSS because it will future-proof your site
for the pie-in-the-sky future when people surf the web on mobile
devices"? Well, it's crap[2].

There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS:
automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced
bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim
to know a lot about[7]), among others. But "because it'll future-proof
your site for the next generation of mobile devices" is not one of them.
The theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile
devices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice.
Oops.

_Jeffrey Zeldman_: Party like it's 1997[1]. "Microsoft has redesigned.
Its new layout uses font tags and other deprecated junk straight out of the
mid-1990s. ... When a W3C member company that helped create XHTML and CSS
ignores or misuses those web standards on its corporate site, you have to
wonder who didn't get the memo."

The new design also fails even the most basic accessibility tests[2]; the home
page contains 80 instances of images without ALT text. This is the same basic
failing for which the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games was
successfully sued in 2000[3].

Here is what microsoft.com looks like in a text-only browser[4]. (To better
understand the experience, take a piece of paper and cover your entire monitor
except for the top line, then scroll the window slowly so you can only read one
line at a time.) While nothing is technically locked out (all the links are
regular links, nothing requires Javascript to function properly), all the
un-ALT-enhanced images (which are mostly spacer images and images-as-bullets)
add so much clutter to the page that it's very difficult to navigate.

Meanwhile, I don't want to imagine what it would sound like through a screen
reader. Want to find the search box? That's "1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans
dot gif search for 1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans dot gif form edit box 1pttrans dot
gif submit button go 1pttrans dot gif link advanced search 1pttrans dot gif
..." And I hope you weren't looking for Microsoft's accessibility home
page[5]; it's the 76th link on the page (out of 76).

population growth, but still, our fleshless offspring's numbers point to a
machinery future:

Some 20,000 domestic-help robots were sold worldwide last year, half
designed to mow lawns. Vacuum-cleaning robots were introduced late in 2001
and a study in Sweden found that 5,000 were sold in the last two months of
the year. Window-cleaning robots are set to boom, said the U.N. study.

The President's niece will no longer have to forge prescriptions for Valium.
All she'll have to do is participate in an unruly public demonstration to get a
free dose. Unfortunately for her, the government has no plans to shoot rocks of
cocaine at demonstrators, so she'll still have to depend on her drug dealer for
that.

The U.S. military is exploring ways to use drugs such as Valium to calm
people without killing them during riots or other crowd control situations
where lethal weapons are inappropriate.

A San Francisco cabbie -- generally a well-educated and firm-opinion-holding
class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my
(non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco?

In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you
phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order,
not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request...

So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all?
In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a
driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an
employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to
independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as
disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor
drivers can't unionize.

Rob "Pringles Can" Flickenger and others Cliff Skolnik at the O'Reilly OS X con
has tracked down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network
here -- every 20 or 30 seconds, you start getting "connection refused" messages
from your browser and other net-utilities. Rob "Pringles Can" Flickenger wrote
it up.

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other
"promiscuous" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a "rejected" message.

So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa).
Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Discuss[3] (_

The WSJ has published a round-up of phone companies, wired and wireless,
ranking them based on performance and price. They don't mention Nextel, whose
hullking milspec i700 handset I've been carrying for years now, with incredible
reception all over the US and Canada. Their front-line customer service sucks,
but the prices and network can't be beat.

T-Mobile is in the midst of a massive makeover. In recent months, the
company changed its name and launched an ad campaign featuring Ms. Zeta
Jones.

The company has a history worth hiding. T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche
Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received
1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the
worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate
has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements.

But T-Mobile is the cheapest wireless provider, available, with an average
cost of just 8.2 cents per minute. (Verizon, by contrast, costs 14.3 cents
per minute.)

Great Village Voice story about oddball museums in New York. My favorite
weird-ass museum is the Museo de Criminologia in San Jose, Costa Rica, which
has bits of victims of famous crimes (machete-dented brain-pans, severed arms,
etc) floating in formaldehyde jars.

A stone's throw away is the singular Freakatorium, El Museo Loco, a classy
treasure chest of curiosities belonging to sword swallower Johnny Fox,
whose focus is the rich history of America's earliest museums, from P.T.
Barnum's American Museum to the Bowery Dime Museums. The walrus penis bone
(other penis bones on display: coyote, mink, fox, raccoon) is enough to
make you feel you're getting your $5 worth. But then you spy the Jivaro
Shrunken Head (it's real, it's the size of a tennis ball); conjoined
piglets in a jar; an assload of taxidermy, including a gorgeous zebra head;
giant's rings...

I guess it's time to reveal the incredibly kind invitation I received[1]. As
many of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument
for the Eldred case[2] before the Supreme Court.

I'm incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would
be quite enough, but seeing such an important case...Dayenu! When Lessig asked
me if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn't (and still
can't) think of anything I'd rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to
Lessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I'm sort of embarassed to
have the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than
me. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by
camping in line with us.

So, I'll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an
Eldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then camping in line with Seth
Schoen[3], Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow. If you'd
like to come with us, let me know.

I was hoping I'd be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who
couldn't make it, but as I read in today's Times, only lawyers and those with
official press credentials are allowed to take notes![4] I think this is
outrageous, but hopefully I will be able to remember enough to provide an
interesting account.

In a related irony, today was "Disney Day" at Borders[5], where they played
Disney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit
of reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through _The Practice of
Programming_.

In an unrelated note, if you haven't been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug,
I highly recommend it.
