You seem to be saying that whitelists are useless, because there are worms
which can compromise your system, read your address book/whitelist, and
sent themselves on, compromising a nonnegligible fraction of systems as
they go along.

While mailing lists can be spam/worm amplifiers, I don't think this is
true for individual users even today. Moreover, worms which use email as
vector exist *only* because a single vendor ships mailers with broken
default settings, and insists to make documents executables. This makes
for very bad press, and eventually that vendor is going to wise up, and
stop shipping as many broken wares (or people will switch to more secure
alternatives, whatever comes first).
