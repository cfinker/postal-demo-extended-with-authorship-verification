Spammers fall into two categories. The more
difficult case are those whose back-end business
can be executed entirely in a foreign nation, such
as the 419 spammers. And you're right: there's not
much we can do about those, except filter them in
various ways. But the vast majority of spammers
have a back-end business that requires a native
presence. Debt consolidation. Mortgages. Herbalife
and other MLMs. Even porn sites require credit
card transactions. That means the people responsible
CAN be found.

There have been some successful suits, but (a) it
takes too much effort, and (b) the result isn't enough
to deter the spammer. But you're talking about action
constrained by law. In an anarchy, people act more
directly, with less cost, and to more effect. Spammers
very quickly would learn their lesson. Except for the
ones who ply their scam in a foreign country.

Of course, that's assuming there are ISPs and other
infrastructure in an anarchy. Arguing about how things
would work without the state involves a large degree
of counterfactual reasoning.

Hmm. I've lived most of my life in houses that did
not have central heating, including my current abode.
As to the crapper, it did not do nearly as much to
improve waste management in cities as did the public
sewers which it feeds, and the water lines that supply
it. Without these, you would find that a chamber pot
works just as well.
