I'm sure this is common knowledge already, but just in case ...

This paper presents a new generation of attacks against Microsoft
Windows, and possibly other message-based windowing systems. The
flaws presented in this paper are, at the time of writing,
unfixable. The only reliable solution to these attacks requires
functionality that is not present in Windows, as well as efforts on
the part of every single Windows software vendor. Microsoft has
known about these flaws for some time; when I alerted them to this
attack, their response was that they do not class it as a flaw -
the email can be found here. This research was sparked by comments
made by Microsoft VP Jim Allchin who stated, under oath, that there
were flaws in Windows so great that they would threaten national
security if the Windows source code were to be disclosed. He
mentioned Message Queueing, and immediately regretted it. However,
given the quantity of research currently taking place around the
world after Mr Allchin's comments, it is about time the white hat
community saw what is actually possible.
