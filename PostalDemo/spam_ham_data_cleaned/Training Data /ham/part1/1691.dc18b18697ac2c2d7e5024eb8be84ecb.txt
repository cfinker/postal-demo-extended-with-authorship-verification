I think perhaps you missed the fact that SA scores are adjustable. If
you want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this
in your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.

score RAZOR_CHECK 10

The default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5.
Therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA
then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5
would be sufficient.

If you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient.
Otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once
for SA and once again afterward. If you really want to run Razor
individually then you should set the 'score RAZOR_CHECK 0' so that SA
won't do it and avoid the double network hit.

However, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has
been the history of false positive reports in the razor database. The
current score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam.
But for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold.
Razor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide
of use as Razor1.
