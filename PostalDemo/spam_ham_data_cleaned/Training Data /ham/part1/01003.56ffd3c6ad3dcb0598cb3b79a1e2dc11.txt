Hmm.. I've seen the *opposite* issue - if I go to *SEND* a signed message,
sometimes Exmh will put up the dialog box, but fail to set keyboard focus
there, so no passphrase can be entered. Of course, hitting 'return' doesnt
work so you need to click the 'OK' box, at which point it finds that the
passphrase that wasn't entered doesn't work, and asks again, this time with
proper focus set.

I suspect some variable/codepath is getting hosed for the focus, or possibly
some borkedness with --no-tty and/or --status-fd flags to gnupg.
