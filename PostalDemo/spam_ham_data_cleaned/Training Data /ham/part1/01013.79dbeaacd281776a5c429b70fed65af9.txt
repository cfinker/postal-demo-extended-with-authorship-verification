Bad assumption.

A reasonable UI would have me enter my passphrase *at most* each
time I launch my mail program -- never more than once per day,
sometimes once per week.

For some of myy workstations, I'd even be happy with the necessary
signing key being cached on disk, so signing is automatic when I
hit 'send'.

If spammer code can read my local hard disk, I have bigger problems
than spoofed spam.
