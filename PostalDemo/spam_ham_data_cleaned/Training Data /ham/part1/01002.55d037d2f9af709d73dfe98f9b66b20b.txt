>Users don't like entering passphrases when sending email.

If you're using the mail client on your personal
machine, there's no reason you would need to enter
a passphrase, unless that is part of how you secure
the data on your personal machine. You're private
key is as secure as any other data on your machine.
If you're working remotely, you already have to
enter a passphrase to get to your email.
