As long as the OS doesn't give you a convenient GetPassPhrase() method
that threat model is theoretical. Worms are autonomous, and autonomous
worms are not that smart.

However, that's the reason I mentioned crypto hardware (USB fobs, smart
cards, etc).

While this is a good idea, the concept of security is holistic. It
involves a secure OS, secure apps, and crypto hardware.

I believe I mentioned users can't be bothered to enter passphrases. That's
what tokens are there for. At some point we can expect a convenient USB
port on the keyboard, or the video device front. Meanwhile, my Net PC
server sitting by the CRT with front USB ports will do.
