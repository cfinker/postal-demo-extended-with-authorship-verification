The case against theft also acknowledges that the value to the thief is
often far less than the value to the victim. Stealing my $1,000 sterio
and then fencing it for $50 does not result in 'no loss' the the economy
overall. For the same reason that voluntary transactions increase
social value, involuntary ones decrease it. If the sterio was worth as
much to the theif as it was to me he'd buy it ...

On the flip side of this, common law allows a breach of property law in
precisely the type of scenarios where a net social gain is recorded but
the owner's availability to make a contract was problematic. Breaking
into your isolated cabin because I'm starving, for example, is
permissible if I later offer restitution for the damage I caused and the
food I ate.
