"Using a laptop computer in the shadow of Big Ben, we
identified 26 parcels of confidential computer information."
- and inside each was a delicious chocolate treat

>> HARD NEWS > EVENT QUEUE > TRACKING > MEMEPOOL > GEEK MEDIA > the week's late-night sci-fi selection starts off with
Yul Brunner 1970s post-apocalyptic beat-em-up THE ULTIMATE
WARRIOR (12.40am, Fri, C5), John "The Last Seduction" Dahl's
bonkers brainscanner UNFORGETTABLE (2.05am, Fri, C4), and the
seems-to-last-an-eternity STARGATE (11.05pm, Sat, BBC1)... the
BBC have swiftly replaced the advertised showing of serial
killer psycho-profiler "Messiah 2" with repeats of THE LOST
WORLD (9.15pm, Sat, BBC1)... and, considering what came after,
AMERICAN PIE (9.05pm, Sat, C4) may be eventually regarded as
one of the great teen movies of all time... it's a double-
Arnie fertility-horror double-bill in TWINS (6.20pm, Sun,
BBC1) and JUNIOR (4.50pm, Mon, BBC1)... Nell McAndrew and
Rhona Cameron contribute to a slightly vague interpretation of
"celebrity" in I'M A CELEBRITY - GET ME OUT OF HERE! (8pm,
Sun, ITV)... WHEN [DIANA] DIED - DEATH OF A PRINCESS (9pm,
Sun, C4) contains "scenes of nudity and religious ritual" -
funny what people find offensive nowadays ... and Jeff "Tron"
Bridges plays the other half of that K-Pax double-act in
STARMAN (2.30pm, Mon, C5) - all together now: "You don't
understand, Mrs Hayden: that *thing* is no longer your
husband!"... archaeology imitates "Coneheads" in ANCIENT
MURDER MYSTERY: RIDDLE OF THE CONE-SHAPED SKULLS (8pm, Mon,
C5)... odd scheduling for Bill Murray's kid-friendly identity
mixup THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE (11.05pm, Tue, BBC1)... and
if only they'd got hold of Tim Burton's recent "reimagining"
to show after the run of BATTLE FOR/ FAREWELL TO/ BACK TO
THE PLANET OF THE APES (1.30pm, Tue-Thu, ITV), you could have
watched the franchise deteriorate before your very eyes...

FILM>> good to see Time Magazine's staff staying cool long
enough to publish their final "Humanity Doomed" collectors'
edition for the backstory of "X-Files" director Rob Bowman's
"2000AD"-style Brit-set monster apocalypse REIGN OF FIRE
( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/reignoffire.htm : "Here's
to evolution!"; many deaths by incineration; child permitted
in hardhat construction area; massive tattoos)... it's Martin
"Bad Boys" Lawrence and Academy Award nominee Tom "In The
Bedroom" Wilkinson - together at last! - in funnier-than-
you'd-expect "Galaxy Quest"/"A Knight's Tale" hybrid BLACK
KNIGHT ( http://www.screenit.com/movies/2001/black_knight.html :
[Lawrence] does all sorts of mugging and facial contortions at
the camera that some kids might want to imitate; we hear the
King fart at dinner; some kids might want to imitate all of
the action-based fighting that occurs)... or there's badfilm
stalwart Heather Graham and "My Cousin Vinny" Academy Award
winner Marisa "In The Bedroom" Tomei in clumsy Bollywood porn
comedy pastiche THE GURU ( http://www.bbfc.co.uk/ : Contains
strong sex references and language)...

DRESS DOWN FRIDAY>> after an unexpected 3-month hiatus -
because, hey, who buys t-shirts in the summer? - NTK's online
store is back to full strength at http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/
and now features lengthy explanations of exactly what PayPal
will attempt to charge you. Also new this month: lots of
designs now available in XXL, including the ever-popular 404
/SHIRT/TIE NOT FOUND, a glow-in-the-dark variant of the ZX
font BORN TO RUN one, plus slightly more limited numbers of
the arcade-style HI-SCORE TABLE and the last few remaining
souvenirs from June's EXTREME COMPUTING show. Oh and copies of
Mark Bennett's BLACK ICE magazine (for just US$7 plus postage
and packing) - Brighton's very own answer to "Mondo 2000"...
meanwhile, your entries have continued to flood in, a leading
contender being CHRIS HOWE's possibly Designers-Republic-
influenced http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/chrismessiah.gif
- though his email address appears to have changed recently,
so if anyone knows where he is, could you ask him to get in
touch? We also enjoyed JAMES SWIFT's politically motivated
http://www.3dengineer.com/tshirts/privacylogged.gif , BRUCE's
heartfelt http://www.growf.org/shirts/crack.gif , and ASHLEY
POMEROY's whimsical http://www.ashleypomeroy.com/arpshirts.gif
- but remained puzzled by people sending us what appear to be
parodies of our existing parody designs, from OWAIN KENWAY's
http://www.angelfire.com/scifi2/dsky/1337spotting.html through
to JOF's http://www.overhope.org.uk/misc/revolution.jpg and
PAUL "THE FRIDAY THING" CARR's perhaps over-self-explanatory:
http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/tft-shirt.jpg . And if your
design skills aren't up to this high standard, you can of
course just mail us a text slogan, so long as it's at least as
funny as SIMON LIPSON's "NTK: ROTFL meets ROT-13", ANDREW
SIMMONS' "NTK: Notes you don't want to save, and for link
evaluation", or PHIL SOUTH's "Frieze - Marther - Farquhar" -
but designed to look like it's the name of a law company!...
meanwhile, the http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/ gallery
reveals the "Buy One, Subvert The Mass Media, Get One Free"
contest to be hotting up once again, as 25-year-old web
designer GRAEME DAVISON "just happened" to be wearing the
shirt that spells "fuck" in ASCII URL-encoding when he was
photographed by THE NORTHERN ECHO about his trip to see
"Attack Of The Clones" open in LA. Even though this was only a
local newspaper, the judging panel felt he deserved the full
prize (of another t-shirt), as the story goes on to cover the
ostensibly pointless nature of the entire exercise. That's the
kind of product placement that money just can't buy...

>> SMALL PRINT <<

Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
