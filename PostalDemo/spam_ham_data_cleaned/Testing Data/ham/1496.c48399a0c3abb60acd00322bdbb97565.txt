I don't know if there's a sendmail-ish way (it's not in the -d0.1 output),
but this should work:

$ strings `which sendmail` | grep -i milter

If you get a long list of function/message looking phrases, milter
is built-in. If you get something like:

Warning: Filter usage ('X') requires Milter support (-DMILTER)
Milter Warning: Option: %s requires Milter support (-DMILTER)
@(#)$Id: milter.c,v 1.1.1.2 2002/03/12 18:00:36 zarzycki Exp $

then it's not built-in. :)
