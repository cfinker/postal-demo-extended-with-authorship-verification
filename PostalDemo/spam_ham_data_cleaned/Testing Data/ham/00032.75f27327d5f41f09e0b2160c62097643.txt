I reckon that the Cat[s] will be more interested in the fish in the gaf.
I've got these huge fish [12inchers currently but still growing].

I know someone else with them too alonmg with a couple of cats, anyway one
day the cats sat on top of the tank waiting for the fish to do a swim-by and
they readied their paws for the kill. Trouble is the fish were also
interested in a feed and they were significantly faster than the cats. [They
could'nt actually hurt them as they only eat fish/very small rodents] in the
wild. But the cats got the fright of their lives and now they just sit
across the room from the fish warey of approaching the glass ;-)

Personally I've been bitten many times, but only drew blood once so far.

I wan't to thank all that replied to my totally OT mail, I never knew that
so many people were into our wee friends.

not my obsession - evolutions.

anyway.. i dont like mice and rats, esp. not in the house. and we've
not had one in the house since we got our present cat.

:)

its mostly mice though. and they will eventually (after a few summers)
stop bringing their kills back to the house, once they realise that
you're not interested and are never going to learn to hunt.

(they're trying to teach you hunting basically. they do the same with
kittens - first bring back kills, and then later they bring back live
but injured prey for the kittens to practice on).

although they'll still bring back stuff on occassion.
