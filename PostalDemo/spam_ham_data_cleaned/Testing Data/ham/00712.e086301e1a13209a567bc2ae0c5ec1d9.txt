Pastry is a generic, scalable and efficient substrate for peer-to-peer
applications. Pastry nodes form a decentralized, self-organizing and
fault-tolerant overlay network within the Internet. Pastry provides
efficient request routing, deterministic object location, and load balancing
in an application-independent manner. Furthermore, Pastry provides
mechanisms that support and facilitate application-specific object
replication, caching, and fault recovery.
