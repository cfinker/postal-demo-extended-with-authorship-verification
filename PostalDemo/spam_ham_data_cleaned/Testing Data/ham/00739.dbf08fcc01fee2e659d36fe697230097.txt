Can anyone access the CVS server for exmh?
The last thing I was able to do was try a "cvs commit", but
I got an "up-to-date check failed" for a couple files,
exmh.CHANGES and lib/msg.tcl, I think, so I then tried "cvs update".
I get a password prompt, and then it just hangs.

cat CVS/Root
welch@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/exmh
