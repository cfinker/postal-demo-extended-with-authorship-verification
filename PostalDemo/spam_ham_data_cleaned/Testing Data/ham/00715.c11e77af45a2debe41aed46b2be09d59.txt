Music school jokes --

American conductor and European conductor are talking. European conductor
says "what a week, I've had 5 rehearsals and a performance." "That's
nothing," says the American conductor, "I've had five performances and a
rehearsal."

What's the difference between a spring in the desert surrounded by palm
trees and a violist that plays in tune? A violist that plays in tune is a
mirage.

What's the difference between a rat and a guitar player? The rat's got
something to do tonight.

Good thing it's not comedy school.
