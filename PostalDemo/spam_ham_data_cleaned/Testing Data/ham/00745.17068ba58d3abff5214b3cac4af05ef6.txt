Let me answer my own question.
This seems to be a problem in tk8.4.
There is a switch statement at lines 691-697 in ispell.tcl inside a catch.
It ends with a line ending with a backslash, followed by a blank line.

This seems to be enough to confuse this verson of tk. Removing the backslash
causes the error to go away, and the catch is not executed.
