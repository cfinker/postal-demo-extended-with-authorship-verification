Chris,

I think you are referring to a problem I noticed last October (see
attached email). If I remember correctly, the binding for SeditBeautify
is being applied outside of the sedit window and that results in the
behavior observed.

It appears that the binding for SeditBeautify applies to
more than just the sedit window. Since SeditBeautify assumes
we are in a sedit window the routine fails. (Try typing
ctrl-l over the main window to see what I mean).

The quick fix for this is to make the ^l more restrictive. However, I'd
suggest keeping things the way the are and extending ^l to be a
highlight toggle. If the window is currently highlighted (sedit or msg)
re-display without highlighting and vice versa.

While I can hack tcl, hacking tk is another story. Translation: I can't
fix this bug myself. Any volunteers?

Kevin
