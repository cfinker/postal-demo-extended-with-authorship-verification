Looks cute. For what it's worth I worked closely with a few
of the people on the team. One was my officemate for years.

Unfortunately there's no way I'm loading all the .NET stuff
on my machine. Not yet. And hopefully by the time it's all
stable, I'll be running FreeBSD again on my laptop, and it will
be moot anyway.
