Sure - discussion in Forbes - rigorous research, that. Especially when
the data in their own list
contradicts them. I continue to look at the list and all the "inherited,
growed" entries. I guess if
I read it enough times my vision will clear.

I, at on point, looked into Stanford Business School. After learning
that tuition was > 20K,
no financial aid was available, and part-time work was disallowed, this
smart person decided
that I was not willing to spend the $150 application fee
(non-refundable). During attendance at
my local business school, I was told repeatedly I should have gone for
it - to quote a prof, (Northwestern MBA), it
has nothing to do with the education you receive - in general European
(and Canadian) business
schools are better and more innovative - its the connections. He used
the words "American nobility."

"invented" being the right word. Dubya went to Yale and HBS. I guess
"practically" gets you
around that problem.

Its interesting but in this part of the World (Nova Scotia) a recent
study found that college graduates
earn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools).
They did decline to mention
that the demand for some trades is so great that some of
them are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record -
the average salary for
a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$
21,000 -- stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept

Much as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I
have difficulty finding any - except of course for
labor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well
unless the supply is tight)
It was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the
self-made billionaires on
the list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the
concept of "more stuff, cheaper"
which it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly
galling example is
high-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that
it is an area where the pricing
approaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the
telecom industry (maintain your
monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through
the same regulators) meet.
Sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole
entertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing
seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer
seems less important than using
regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to
produce profits for the favored few.

I usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office - I feel like
they're the biggest believers in
the Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the
rights of that "proletariat" you've
just created with bogus "law and order" policies , concentrate capital
in the hands of a few (ideally people
who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh,
and lie - use
the word "compassionate" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain
amount of poverty reduction actually
helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the
Republic party seems to be the more homeless under
each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.

And the facts are, for most people in the Western world are declining
standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,
greater working hours, essentially since the entrance of women into the
work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right
to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining
standards of living) is the reality.

Again to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to -
the CIA world factbook - on the US economy:

"Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to
the top 20% of households"
