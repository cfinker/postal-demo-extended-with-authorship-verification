I installed Spamassassin 2.41 with Razor V2 the other day and it has =
been working great. I decided to add Pyzor last night and I got that =
installed successfully (I think, no errors). I am using spamd and I see =
where it periodically spawns off a pyzor process; however nothing has =
been detected as spam by Pyzor under Spamassassin. It has been running =
for almost half a day now on a 5,000 user mail server - so to me the =
odds of something being caught by it should be high. I run spamd as =
follows:

spamd -d -H

and all my users home directories have a .pyzor directory with the =
server listed under it.

I setup a test procmail recipe that just invokes pyzor check and not =
spamc to see if in fact pyzor alone catches any spam - I just set this =
up so no results yet. Here is what I get when I check connectivity to =
the pyzor server:

pyzor -d ping
sending: 'User: anonymous\nTime: 1031921041\nSig: =
161c547ac6248589910f97b1b5cd37e6dffc8eaf\n\nOp: ping\nThread: 14733\nPV: =
2.0\n\n'
received: 'Thread: 14733\nCode: 200\nDiag: OK\nPV: 2.0\n\n'
167.206.208.233:24442 (200, 'OK')

Any help/examples would be appreciated. Thanks! BTW, keep up the great =
work Spamassassin team!
