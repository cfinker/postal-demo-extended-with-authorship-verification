If you run Pick, and then use the "New FTOC" button to show only
those messages selected by pick, then the ftoc display was considered
"invalid" in the old code. This prevented the display from being cached,
and it meant that you could get back to the full folder display by
clicking on the folder lablel. That doesn't work anymore. You have
to resort to Rescan Folder. In fact, when you change folders you
continue to have the Pick results, not the new folder contents.
If you go to a any folder and do Rescan, then it heals itself.
