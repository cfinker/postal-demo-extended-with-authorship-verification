[1] Covalent works with Microsoft to provide ASP.NET capabilities for
Apache 2.0. ASP.NET actually has some really elegant tools for doing
load testing and analysis. Perhaps Microsoft's desire to embrace, extend, and
extinguish comes from a scathing Gartner report recommending not to deploy
IIS for enterprise applications at all. Now users get the best of both
worlds: all the development tools of ASP.Net and the security and reliability
of Apache.
