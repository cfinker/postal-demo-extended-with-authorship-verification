I'm running with autosort right now. If I don't see any problems, I' run with
autopack for a while.

I did find some stuff that was being called too many times when auto-sort was
enabled, but otherwise it seems to be working.

My computer is a lot faster than the last time I tried autosort (back in the
mid-90s); this is actually acceptable.

Once I've confirmed that nothing actually breaks, I think I'll look into a few
more places that autosort needs to be called, because right now it only sorts
when you change to a folder, but if a new message arrives in the folder you're
looking at, it doesn't get sorted.
