Doesn't apply to this one; you're off by three orders of magnitude.
Only 2km diametre, this one. Of course, that's still a lot of mass
to hit the planet even if it *is* in the form of dust and gas.
Even if Shrub's wrist-rocket managed to vaporise it, we'd still get
transference to the Earth's energy balance, only to the atmosphere
rather than the litho- or hydrosphere.
