Hi,

Want to increase your chances of winning a big jackpot in those
Internet contests?

Michael Khalili, the famous programmer who you may have read about
in USA Today and other newspapers, came up with a method that makes
it hundreds of times easier to win online.

He recently wrote a program that will AUTOMATICALLY enter you in
online contests--over and over UNTIL YOU WIN (or tell it to stop).
We at Grab.com are so excited by this system that we're putting it
online for our members to use.

THE PRIZE IS YOURS - GUARANTEED!

If you win a contest using this program, the prize is legally yours
to keep--GUARANTEED! Our lawyers assured us that Michael's program
is legal, and online contest sponsors have CONFIRMED that it doesn't
violate their rules. So if you win a prize, you'll receive it.
If you don't receive it, we'll pay you ourselves. GUARANTEED.

FREE TO USE.

Best of all, this service is free to use. All you pay for is related
network expenses--which only cost $1 for 7 days of the service.
That's dozens of entries for what you'd usually pay to get a single
lottery ticket!

As a member in good standing of this mailing, we've already
set up the automatic entry system for you. All that's left
is for you to turn it on. Once you do, you can sit back and watch it
enter you into contest after contest after contest after contest....

Click
here to begin!

P.S. This system will continue to enter you into hundreds of free
contests until you win (or cancel it).

P.P.S. All the prizes you win are yours to keep--GUARANTEED!
